<h2><i>Preface</i></h2>


<p>When a tourist who, having mapped out his itinerary
in accordance with the time at his disposal for a
European trip, arrives at a city for seeing which he has
allowed two or three days at the utmost, the first question
he puts to a fellow traveller, the hotel clerk, or his Baedeker
is, "What must I see?"</p>

<p>First, there is the city itself: its streets, bridges, canals,
parks, and drives. Then there are famous churches, city
halls, and other ancient buildings, including city gates and
castles in the immediate neighborhood. Perhaps there is a
palace, and most certainly one or more museums of art and
antiquities. The tourist gazes his fill on architecture, stone
and wood carving, exterior and interior; but above all he
feels that he must make the best use of his opportunities of
seeing the pictures, the fame of which has spread into all
civilized countries. His time is short. He is therefore
grateful for a guide that will direct him to the beauties and
celebrities of the famous local picture-gallery, and point
out to him the qualities of the paintings as well as tell him
something of the art of the masters and of the school to
which they belong. It is important first for him to know
what he should see, and secondly what he should see in it
beyond the bare facts he can gather from the catalogue.</p>

<p>On returning home with a few photographs of the canvases
that have struck his fancy, he is also pleased to
renew his acquaintance with the gallery in the pages of a
modest work that does not go too deeply into art questions
beyond the grasp of the ordinary layman. Such a guide
and companion this book aims to be; it leads the tourist
rapidly through the most important picture-galleries of
Holland, and points out the pictures that all the world talks
about; and gives some account of the Dutch masters,
their qualities and characteristics as exemplified in their
works, there and elsewhere. It does not pretend to be
exhaustive, and confines itself almost exclusively to the
consideration of the examples of native schools.</p>

<p>On going through a gallery the visitor, in accordance
with his individual tastes, will frequently be halted by a
picture whose fame has not reached him, but whose beauty
appeals to him quite as much as the celebrities with which
he is familiar from numberless reproductions, such as
Potter's Bull, Rembrandt's Night Watch, or <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Frans 'Snijders,' 'Snyders,' 'Snyder,' and 'Synders' were used in this text. This was retained.">Snyder</ins>'s Boar
Hunt. The traveller is tempted to linger over the little pictures
of the Little Masters, the charming interiors, marines,
landscapes, and still life of the galaxy of painters of the
seventeenth century. It is for this reason, therefore, that
for illustrating the following pages I have selected many of
the less familiar examples of the art of that period. Sir
Joshua Reynolds, who was a sound art critic as well as a
great painter&mdash;an unusual combination of qualities&mdash;described
with fine appreciation the pleasure derived from the
contemplation of the works of the Dutch school. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The most considerable of the Dutch school are Rembrandt,
Teniers, Jan Steen, Ostade, Brouwer, Gerard Dow, Mieris, Metsu,
and Terburg,&mdash;these excel in small conversations. For landscapes
and cattle, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouvermans</ins>, P. Potter, Berchem, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruysdael</ins>; and for
buildings, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van der Heyden,' 'Van der Heyde,' and 'Venderheydene' were used in this text. This was retained.">Venderheyden</ins>. For sea-views, W. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">Vandervelde</ins>, jun., and
Backhuysen. For dead game, Weenix and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondekoeter</ins>. For
flowers, De Heem, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Vanhuysum,' 'Van Huysum,' and 'Huysum' were used in this text. This was retained.">Vanhuysum</ins>, Rachael Roos, and Brueghel. These
make the bulk of the Dutch school.</p>

<p>"I consider those painters as belonging to this school, who painted
only small conversations, landscapes, etc. Though some of these
were born in Flanders, their works are principally found in Holland&mdash;and
to separate them from the Flemish school, which generally
painted figures large as life, it appears to me more reasonable to
class them with the Dutch painters, and to distinguish those two
schools rather by their style and manner, than by the place where the
artist happened to be born.</p>

<p>"Rembrandt may be considered as belonging to both or either, as
he painted both large and small pictures.</p>

<p>"A clearness and brilliancy of coloring may be learned by examining
the flower-pieces of De Heem, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Vanhuysum,' 'Van Huysum,' and 'Huysum' were used in this text. This was retained.">Huysum</ins>, and Mignon; and
a short time employed in painting flowers would make no improper
part of a painter's study. Rubens's pictures strongly remind one
of a nosegay of flowers, where all the colors are bright, clear, and
transparent.</p>

<p>"A market woman with a hare in her hand, a man blowing a
trumpet, or a boy blowing bubbles, a view of the inside or outside
of a church, are the subjects of some of their most valuable pictures;
but there is still entertainment, even in such pictures&mdash;however uninteresting
their subjects, there is some pleasure in the contemplation
of the imitation. But to a painter they afford likewise instruction
in his profession; here he may learn the art of coloring and composition,
a skilful management of light and shade, and indeed all
the mechanical parts of the art, as well as in any other school
whatever.</p>

<p>"The same skill which is practised by Rubens and Titian in
their large works, is here exhibited, though on a smaller scale.
Painters should go to the Dutch school to learn the art of painting
as they would go to a grammar school to learn languages. They
must go to Italy to learn the higher branches of knowledge."</p></div>

<p>In attempting to be of some service to the art lover
who has no leisure for extended and independent study,
I have by no means relied entirely upon my own impressions
and observation.</p>

<p>In describing the pictures, I have drawn largely on the
writings of the best English, French, German, and Dutch
art critics and historians,&mdash;Crowe, Reynolds, Blanc, Burger,
Havard, Fromentin, Michel, Mainz, Wurtz, Bode, Bredius,
and many others.</p>

<p>When so many authorities disagree with one another
in the spelling of the names of the Dutch artists, I have
endeavored to avoid all criticism by adopting the spelling
used in the official catalogues of The Hague, Amsterdam,
and Rotterdam galleries; and in a few instances these
are not agreed.</p>

<p>For valuable aid in compiling this work, my thanks are
due to Mr. Arthur Shadwell Martin.</p>

<h2><br />THE HAGUE GALLERY</h2>

<h3>THE OLD MAURITSHUIS</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Not far from the Binnenhof, on the Vijver, where
the principal historic buildings of The Hague are
grouped, stands the Mauritshuis, now the home of one of the
most famous collections of paintings in Europe. Originally it
was the palace of Prince John Maurice of Nassau, Governor
of Brazil, who, on his return to his fatherland in the year
1644, found it completed and took up his residence there.</p>

<p>This splendor-loving prince had had this building erected
to please his own tastes by the court architect of The
Hague, Pieter Post, after the plans of Jacob van Campen,
the designer of the Dam Palace in Amsterdam and other
buildings; and for the decoration of the interior he had
sent rare and costly woods from Brazil. Everything was
heavily gilded and painted; and, in particular, a very artistic
staircase attracted universal admiration. Brazilian
landscapes painted by Frans Post, richly carved <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'chimney-piece' and 'chimney piece' were used in this text. This was retained.">chimney-pieces</ins>,
and exotic objects of every kind adorned the halls;
but, alas! in 1704 all this magnificence was destroyed by
a fire, and only the walls of the palace remain.</p>

<p><b>The Restored Building made into an Art Gallery.</b>&mdash;The
exterior of the building was restored just as it was
originally; but the interior was finished in a much simpler
style that does not in the least suggest the splendor of the

<p>It was not until the year 1820 that the Mauritshuis was
devoted by royal decree to its present use,&mdash;the sheltering
of the royal picture collection, which was at that
time combined with the Cabinet of Rarities, now in the
Rijks Museum in Amsterdam.</p>

<p><b>History of the Collection.</b>&mdash;The collection has an interesting
history as a whole; and the majority of the pictures
have their own special history. The nucleus of the gallery
formed the collection of the last Stadtholder of the Netherlands,
William V. of Orange.</p>

<p>The Princes of Orange were art-collectors as early as the
beginning of the sixteenth century. Although we do not
know much regarding the art tastes of Prince Maurice of
Orange, who died in 1625, yet we learn from a document
that he employed <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Esais' and 'Esaias' van de Velde were used in this text. This was retained.">Esais</ins> <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins> as a court painter. On
the other hand, we do know that his brother, Prince <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Frederik Hendrik' and 'Frederick Henry' (or vice versa) were used in this text. This was retained.">Frederick Hendrik</ins>,
was a collector of fine taste and a M&aelig;cenas.
He employed a great number of important artists, among
whom were Rembrandt, Honthorst, Dirck Bleker, Cornelis
Vroom, Christiaen Couwenberch, Cornelisz Jacobsz Delff,
Thomas Willeborts, Moses van Uyttenbrouck, Jacob Backer,
Gonzales Coques, Frans Pietersz de Grebber, Dirck Dalens,
Gerrit van Santen, Adriaen Hanneman, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Nicholas' and 'Nicholaes' de Helt were used in this text. This was retained.">Nicholaes</ins> de Helt
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Stocade,' 'Stokade,' and 'Stockade' were used in this text. This was retained.">Stocade</ins>, and Dirck van der Lisse. Besides works by these
artists, he acquired in Antwerp pictures by Rubens, Paulus
de Vos, Adriaen van Utrecht, and others. To the Jesuit
Father Soghers he even gave a golden palette made in The
Hague by the goldsmith Hans Coenraet Brechtel. No
wonder that his widow, Princess Amalia of Solms, following
the ideas of her dead husband, employed Jordaens, Van
Thulden, De Grebber, Casar van Everdingen, Honthorst,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Lievens' and 'Lievensz' were used in this text. This was retained.">Lievens</ins>, Solomon de Bray, Pieter Soutman, and Cornelis
Bris&eacute; to decorate the House in the Wood.</p>

<p>At her death in 1675, she left a collection of two hundred
and fifty pieces, which were divided among her four
daughters. Some of these pictures are now in Dessau and
Moscow, and others in Prussian castles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>William III., who gained the English throne, had a fine
picture-gallery, of which the portrait-painter, Robert Duval
was the director. The greater part of this collection was
sold in Amsterdam in 1713; but a few of these pictures are
still in The Hague Gallery. The latter, however, owes its
importance and distinction to the collection of William V.</p>

<p><b>The Collection of William V. of Orange.</b>&mdash;This prince
purchased his treasures at the best auctions of the day, such
as the Lomier, De la Court, Braamcamp, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Slingelandt' and 'Slingerlandt' were used in this text. This was retained.">Slingerlandt</ins>
collections. A German painter, Tethardt Philip Christian
Haag, was made the director of this gallery, which was established
in the Buitenhof. When the French entered The
Hague in 1795 these pictures were carried to Paris by the
troops and placed in the Louvre. When Napoleon's lucky
star set, the French had the grace to return the pictures that
they had carried away as spoils from various countries; and
on November 20, 1815, the one hundred and ten pictures
belonging to the prince's collection were returned to The
Hague amid the ringing of bells, firing of cannon, and rejoicing
of the people. Although a certain number remained
in France, the chief gems were restored undamaged.</p>

<p><b>Growth of The Hague Gallery.</b>&mdash;In 1817 the gallery
contained only one hundred and twenty-three pictures.
Gradually others were purchased; for example, in 1829,
King William I. bought Rembrandt's Anatomy for 3200
gulden. Very few purchases were made from 1831 to
1874; but during the reign of the art-loving William III.
the gallery was greatly augmented by both purchase and
gift. The growth of the collection is principally the result
of the great generosity of the Baron Victor de Stuers, who
in 1874 issued an admirable catalogue (revised ed., 1895).</p>

<p><b>The Cabinet Pieces.</b>&mdash;The nucleus of this collection,
originally a "princely cabinet," consists of the cabinet
pieces. Therefore we find here pictures (that were highly
valued in their day) by Poelenburgh, Dou, Van Mieris, De
Vois, Schalcken, Netscher, Van der Werff, P. van Dyck,
Ostade, Jan Steen, Ter Borch, and Metsu. There were also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
four Rembrandts, two De Keijsers, three Potters, the beautiful
Moro, and examples by Adriaen and Willem <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>.
The modern additions, generally speaking, do not equal in
interest the original collection. The most important are
two portraits by Hals; a triptych, by Jacob Cornelisz van
Ootsanen, a bequest; an Aert de Gelder, a gift, unfortunately
much restored and spoilt by Houbraken; a signed
still life, by Jan <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Vanhuysum,' 'Van Huysum,' and 'Huysum' were used in this text. This was retained.">van Huysum</ins>; a portrait by Bol; a broad
and spirited Begeyn; a Dusart; a strong, dark, and somewhat
sunken view of The Hague by Jacob van <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>; a
beautiful Van Goyen; a head by Vermeer of Delft; a landscape
by G. du Bois; a wonderful flower-piece by Abraham
van Beyeren; several still-life pictures; and some portraits,
among the latter Moreelse's portrait of himself.</p>

<p><b>Sir Joshua Reynolds's Visit to the Gallery.</b>&mdash;Sir
Joshua Reynolds left an account of his visit to the Prince
of Orange's Gallery in 1781; and among the pictures that
he especially admired are those that critics unite in extolling
to-day. He calls attention to the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>, two
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">Van de Veldes</ins>, the portraits of Rubens's two wives, Rembrandt's
Portrait of a Young Man, a Conversation by Ter Borch
(The Despatch it is now called), Van Dijck's Portrait of
Simons the Painter, Teniers's Kitchen, two Ostades, a landscape
by Rubens, Paul Potter's <i>Vache qui se mire</i>, the Inside
of a Delft Church, by Hoogest (Houckgeest), Fruit,
by De Heem, "done with the utmost perfection"; a Woman
with a Candle, by Gerard Dow; a Woman writing, looking
up and speaking to Another Woman, by Metsu; a picture
of Dutch Gallantry by Mieris,&mdash;"a man pinching the ear
of a dog which lies on his mistress's lap"; a Boy blowing
Bubbles, also by Mieris, and The Flight into Egypt, by
Van der Werff,&mdash;"one of his best."</p>

<p><b>The Vijver Lake.</b>&mdash;But while we have been talking of
the past history of the Mauritshuis and its treasures, we
have failed to notice the Vijver, a pretty lake bordered
with trees and dotted with islands, the haunt of swans and
other waterfowl&mdash;descendants, perhaps, of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins>'s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and Weenix's models&mdash;that float upon its glassy surface,
and cut through those quiet reflections of the long line of
picturesque buildings, including the Mauritshuis. The long
quay on the other side is the favorite and fashionable
promenade of The Hague. We must note the Vijver, because
it has been an attractive subject for Dutch painters
of all periods; and the traveller will frequently see representations
of it. One of the most recent is Klinkenberg's
View of the Vijver at The Hague, which was presented to
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Boijmans' and 'Boijman's' were used in this text. This was retained.">Boijman's</ins> Museum in 1876, by the Rotterdam Society for
Promoting Art. The Mauritshuis is represented on the
right. And now, having looked at this building from across
the Vijver, we will pass to the entrance.</p>

<p><b>Paucity of Foreign Pictures in Dutch Galleries.</b>&mdash;The
Dutch galleries differ from many other great European galleries,
such as the National Gallery, the Louvre, the Hermitage,
and the big German galleries, by being devoted almost
exclusively to works of the Dutch and Flemish masters.
Pictures of foreign schools are insignificant in number and
of very slight importance. The foreign pictures in the
Mauritshuis can be dismissed in a few words.</p>

<p><b>Italian Pictures in the Mauritshuis.</b>&mdash;The Italian pictures
include:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Holy Family, by Fra Bartolommeo; Holy Family, by P.
Berettini; Christ Blessing, by P. Bordone; Adoration of Magi,
by C. Caliari; Virgin and Child, and Birth of Virgin, by L.
Cambiaso; Temptation of Adam and Eve, by C. Cignani;
Virgin, Child, and Saints, by M. Fogolino; Massacre of Innocents,
by L. Mazzolini; Holy Family, by F. Santafede; Madonna,
by G. B. Sassoferrato; Annunciation, by F. Solimena;
Holy Family, and two Portraits, by Titian; Venus, Mistress of
the World, by A. Turchi; an Italian Landscape, by F. Zuccherelli;
Cupid (poor copy), by Guido Reni; Venus and Cupid
(copy), by Raphael; two Male Portraits, by Piero de Cosimo;
Female Portrait, by G. Palma; Female Portrait, by A. Allori;
Landscape, by F. Lauri; two Landscapes with Pilgrims, Monks
in a Grotto and Capuchins in a Grotto, by A. Magnasco; two
Ruins, by L. Carlevaris; and Prometheus and Sisyphus, by L.
Giordano.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Of unknown Italian artists of the sixteenth century, the
subjects are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>God the Father and Holy Spirit, Landscape with Mary Magdalen,
Landscape with St. Paul and the Hermit, Death of Abel,
Venus, Dalilah, St. John the Evangelist, Ecce Homo, Martyrdom
of St. Sebastian, and The Musicians.</p></div>

<p><b>Other Foreign Pictures in the Mauritshuis.</b>&mdash;France is
represented only by a portrait by J. A. Aved, A Group of
Merchants by S. Bourdon, and two ideal landscapes by C.
Vernet. The Spanish school is represented by a portrait
by Velasquez, a Virgin and Child by Murillo, a Magdalen
by M. Cereso, and a landscape and a portrait by unknown
artists. The German artists are scarcely more numerous.
There are two portraits by Holbein and three others of his
school, three portraits by B. Beham, an Italian landscape
by J. H. Roos, three portraits by J. F. A. Tischbein, and
four Biblical and one mythological pictures by H. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Rottenhamer' and 'Rottenhammer' were used in this text. This was retained.">Rottenhamer</ins>.
The subjects of these are: The Meeting of David
and Abigail, St. Philip Baptizing the Eunuch, The Rest in
Egypt, Christ Delivering Souls from Purgatory, and The
Fall of Phaeton. The meagre list of foreign works also includes
two portraits by the Danish artist, J. G. Ziesenis.</p>

<p><b>Strength and Weakness of the Gallery.</b>&mdash;The strength
of The Hague Gallery lies mainly in its portraits, either
single or in groups. Of these there are considerably more
than a hundred; of <i>genre</i> pictures there are about seventy,
and of landscape more than sixty. There are nearly fifty
Biblical and religious subjects, and more than thirty taken
from pagan mythology. The Gallery is weak in historical
pictures, of which there are only seventeen. Only seven
canvases represent the great marine painters; and the
pictures of birds, flowers and fruits, and still life are
comparatively few.</p>

<p>The student naturally turns first to the great pictures
that have a world-wide reputation. The two most famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
are undoubtedly Paul Potter's Bull and Rembrandt's Lesson
in Anatomy.</p>

<p><b>Paul Potter's Bull.</b>&mdash;The picture represents an enormous
black and white bull standing on a hillock beneath
two trees. Beneath the trees lie a cow, a sheep, and a
lamb, and behind the trunks stand a ram and a shepherd.
An immense meadow, on which cattle are grazing, stretches
away to the dim horizon, where the buildings of a town
are barely visible. In the broad expanse of sky a bird
soars with outspread wings. The bull is proud and defiant,
with silky hide and loose dewlap, and stands with firmly
planted feet. His eye is savage. This picture has been
the subject of much criticism: the figures of the man, the
sheep, and the lamb have been condemned by most critics,
while the ram's horns have been called "a splendid piece
of sculpture," and the head of the cow "the gem of the
whole work." The face of the cow is marvellous. The
eyes, and the wet and dripping nose and mouth, rivet
the spectator's gaze. He fancies he smells the grass-laden
breath of the animal, and sees her jaw begin to move as
she chews the cud. "No painter ever concentrated so
much life and truthful expression in the face of a ruminant,"
remarks a critic. Strange, then, that the fawn-colored
body and crumpled leg are hard and wooden.</p>

<p>The Bull was painted in 1647, when Paul Potter was but
twenty-two years of age, and was living in Amsterdam and
Haarlem. The picture was purchased in 1749 for 630
florins, and in 1795 was carried by the French to Paris
and placed in the Louvre, where it was ranked as the
fourth most valuable painting,&mdash;the others being Raphael's
Transfiguration, Domenichino's Communion of St. Jerome,
and Titian's Martyrdom of St. Peter. The Dutch government
offered 60,000 florins to Napoleon for its restoration.</p>

<p><b>The Mirrored Cow.</b>&mdash;A more beautiful picture, and
greatly preferred by most critics to the Bull, is the Mirrored
Cow, known generally by the French title, <i>La Vache
qui se mire</i>. This was painted in 1648, and represents a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
beautiful landscape on a hot summer day. The meadows
are flooded with sunshine; a limpid pool on the border of
a forest is shown in the foreground, where cows, goats, and
sheep are lying or standing under the shade of the trees.
Two cows and a sheep stand in the water and are reflected
there; one cow is drinking, and the other has her back to
the spectator and is idly standing in the mud. Boys and
men are swimming or playing on the banks, and two have
evidently finished their bath. On the right is a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'farm-house' and 'farmhouse' were used in this text. This was retained.">farmhouse</ins>
with some cows. One of these an old woman is milking,
and a man stands by with his arm over the cow's back. In
the middle distance a coach and six horses with lackeys
is seen, and in the background the spires and towers of
Rijswick are basking in the sunlight. The castle of Binkhorst
is visible, and Delft lies on the horizon.</p>

La Vache qui se mire" title="" />
<span class="caption">PAUL POTTER<br />
La Vache qui se mire</span>
</div>

<p><b>Criticism of these two Pictures.</b>&mdash;Burger very wittily
said that <i>La Vache qui se mire</i> was a <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>, and not
a <i>hors d'&oelig;uvre</i>, like the Bull. And Sir Joshua Reynolds
noted: "Cattle finely painted by Potter, remarkable for the
strong reflection of one of them in the water: dated 1648."
"How bright, how sunny is this landscape!" exclaims Dr.
Bredius. "How splendidly are all these animals drawn
and modelled! The whole composition is beautiful and full
of charm." It is painted in the small size which Potter
usually preferred, and is one of his greatest creations.</p>

<p><b>Other Pictures by Potter, his Father, and Van der Helst.</b>&mdash;The
third picture by Potter, painted four years later, is
also ranked among his best works. Like the two others it
represents cattle in a meadow.</p>

<p>A portrait of Paul Potter by Van der Helst, painted
shortly before his death (January 27, 1654), hangs near
his masterpieces. It is the only work by which Van der
Helst is represented in The Hague Gallery.</p>

<p>A picture by Paul Potter's father, Pieter Symonsz Potter,
Shepherds with their Troops, signed and dated 1638, is
owned by the Mauritshuis, but a better work is his Straw-Cutter
in the Rijks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Rembrandt.</b>&mdash;The Hague Gallery is particularly rich in
works by Rembrandt (1606-69). The Rijks Museum is
the place to study the great productions of his middle and
last periods; but The Hague Gallery is strong in works of
his first period, owning no less than five painted during the
first ten years of his career.</p>

<p><b>The Anatomy Lesson.</b>&mdash;First, let us look at the most
important work of Rembrandt in this gallery, The Anatomy
Lesson by Dr. Tulp (1632), which made Rembrandt the
most sought-after painter of his time.</p>

<p>Rembrandt was barely settled in Amsterdam and had
painted only a few pictures there when the famous Amsterdam
surgeon, Dr. Nicholaes Tulp, gave him the order to
represent him with his students at an operation for the
Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons, to be hung on the walls of
their dissecting room with other works of a similar nature,
such as the great anatomy pictures by Aert Pietersz (1603),
by Thomas de Keijser (1618), by Claes Elias (1625), two
by Mierevelt (1617), and one by Vosmaer. Rembrandt's
work overshadowed them all. There is a resemblance to
Vosmaer's picture and also to that of De Keijser too striking
to be accidental; but Rembrandt's work shows the
master's genius in the style, the arrangement of the figures,
and the illumination. Bode says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Instead of an accidental arrangement of single persons, a
masterly rounded-out composition has been created, in the happiest
way, and at the most important moment, when at a point
in the lecture to the learned anatomists the interest is concentrated
on the body. The circumstances and the way it is
painted deprive the picture of all disgust. In contrast with his
predecessors, Rembrandt has painted his doctors, not as if
they were having their photographs taken and gazing at the
spectator, but in the most natural way&mdash;some looking at the
body and some at the lecturing Dr. Tulp, Tulp himself quiet,
and explaining his subject with the greatest authority. The
body is painted in a masterly manner and the portraits are
beyond all praise."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Physicians portrayed in the Anatomy Lesson.</b>&mdash;On a
paper held by Hartman Harmansz, the names of the physicians
are inscribed: his own; Matthijs Kalkoen, who is
leaning forward; Jakob de Wit, almost in profile, with
extended neck, looking with extreme attention, with his
collar almost touching the head of the corpse; below him,
Jakob Blok, with fixed glance and furrowed brow; above
Blok, Frans van Loenen, the only one present not a Master
of the Guild; and, finally, lower down in the foreground,
Adriaan Slabbraan, with his back turned to the spectator,
but his head in profile; and Jakob Koolveld, entirely in
profile, the last on the left. All are <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'bare-headed' and 'bareheaded' were used in this text. This was retained.">bareheaded</ins>, robed in
black with plated ruffs, with the exception of Harmansz,
who wears an old-fashioned ruff.</p>

<p>This work remained in the Surgeons' Hall in Amsterdam
until 1828, when King William I. bought it for 32,000
florins.</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds saw it in Amsterdam in 1781, and
thus described it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To avoid making it an object disagreeable to look at,
the figure is but just cut at the wrist. There are seven other
portraits colored like nature itself, fresh and highly finished.
One of the figures behind has a paper in his hand, on which
are written the names of the rest; Rembrandt has also added
his own name with the date, 1672. The dead body is perfectly
well drawn (a little foreshortened), and seems to have been just
washed. Nothing can be more truly the color of dead flesh.
The legs and feet, which are nearest the eye, are in shadow;
the principal light, which is on the body, is by that means preserved
of a compact form. All these figures are dressed in
black.</p>

<p>"Above stairs is another Rembrandt of the same kind of subject;
Professor <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Deyman,' 'Deyment,' and 'Deeman' were used in this text. This was retained.">Deeman</ins><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> standing by a dead body, which is so

each other; the dead man lies on his back with his feet toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the spectator. There is something sublime in the character of
the head, which reminds one of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Michelangelo' and 'Michael Angelo' were used in this text. This was retained.">Michael Angelo</ins>; the whole is
finely painted, the coloring much like Titian."</p></div>

<p><b>Rembrandt's first Important Work.</b>&mdash;Critics are uncertain
as to whether the Presentation in the Temple, also
called Simeon in the Temple, was painted in Leyden or
in Amsterdam, to which city Rembrandt removed in 1631,
the date of this picture; but all agree that it is his first important
work, far exceeding in certainty of composition and
treatment the Simeon of 1628, Peter's Denial of 1628, and
the Good Samaritan of 1631.</p>

<p>In the centre of a temple whose roof is supported by gigantic
columns, the Virgin and St. Joseph make their offering
and present the newborn child, who is in the arms of
Simeon, to the Lord. They gaze tenderly at the infant.
In front of the group stands the High Priest in a long violet
robe, holding up his hands in ecstasy. The light is focussed
on the faces of Mary, Simeon, and Jesus, and falls on the
High Priest's back and hand. Behind the Virgin, who is
dressed in light blue, are two rabbis; and in the background
in the nave are several groups almost imperceptible
in the shadows; and to the right in the chiaroscuro are a
number of persons ascending and descending a flight of
steps, at the top of which stands a priest. In the foreground
on the right two old men are sitting on a bench,
the arm of which bears the monogram "R. H.," and the date
1631. It is supposed that Rembrandt's sister was the
model for Mary. Emile Michel says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The simple garb of the Virgin and St. Joseph and the squalor
of the two beggars beside them emphasize the splendor of the
High Priest and of Simeon, whose heavy cymar seems to be
woven of gems and gold. The execution is a miracle of subtlety
and skill. Note how supreme a colorist has been at work
on the High Priest's cope! With what science is the violet
carried through the lights and shadows, and with what truth are
the tones observed and rendered, with what scrupulous care is
the general harmony preserved in spite of the marvellous treatment
of detail!"</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this picture, so particularly remarkable for its artistic
treatment and composition, Bode exclaims:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"How appropriately are the groups in the halls of the high
fantastic vaults distributed! How masterly is the chief group
in the middle distance! How complete in drawing and action
is every single figure, though so minute! How powerfully is
the light sprinkled over the chief figures before it slowly melts
away into the mystic darkness of the broad nave whereby that
peculiar mood of reverence&mdash;the holy calm of the place&mdash;results
as the most happy effect of handling."</p></div>

<p><b>Lights and Coloring of the Picture.</b>&mdash;Notwithstanding
their smallness, the figures are most completely and expressively
treated, so that in the half-lights the background
shimmers here and there. The coloring equals that of the
other pictures of this period; in the lights, greenish brown
tones come to the aid of the local colors&mdash;blue, violet,
and, very seldom, yellow (next to gray and brown, which are
used only in a very modest way).</p>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'William' and 'Willem' de Poorter were used in this text. This was retained.">William</ins> de Poorter made a striking copy of this picture,
which hangs in the Dresden Gallery.</p>

<p><b>Susanna.</b>&mdash;The chief beauty of Susanna, which bears
the signature "R. f. 1637," lies in the brilliant, warm coloring
which bestows a rich effect on the somewhat ugly form
of the crouching heroine. Bode, like Burger before him,
thinks that he recognizes in the little head the likeness of
Rembrandt's wife, Saskia. The flesh is wonderfully painted,
the figure lifts itself splendidly out from the dark but transparent
background. Moreover, the modelling of the body
leaves nothing to be desired.</p>

<p>Susanna is represented as about to step into the bath and
is alarmed by the presence of the two Elders, one of whom
is seen lurking in the shrubbery. Burger notes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Placed by the side of the School of Anatomy and the Simeon,
the merits of this work are too often overlooked. Yet Susanna,
strongly relieved against a dark background, is one of the most
interesting female figures ever painted by Rembrandt, being remarkably
faithful to nature, though not of classic beauty."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this picture Sir Joshua Reynolds remarks, and many
will agree with him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It appears very extraordinary that Rembrandt should have
taken so much pains and have made at last so very ugly and ill-favored
a figure; but his attention was principally directed to the
coloring and effect, in which it must be acknowledged he has
attained the highest degree of excellence."</p></div>

<p><b>Portraits of Rembrandt and Others.</b>&mdash;The portraits are
of Rembrandt, aged about twenty-two, painted about 1629;
one of his mother, about 1628; one of a young woman,
painted about 1635, supposed to be Saskia van Ulenborgh,
whom Rembrandt married in 1634; a portrait of Rembrandt
as an officer, about 1635, and one of an old man's head, supposed
to be that of his brother Adriaen Harmensz van Rijn
(1597-8-1654), painted in 1650.</p>

</div>

<p>The portrait of himself is one of Rembrandt's earliest
known pictures and was painted in Leyden between 1628
and 1629. It belongs to similar works that are now in Cassel,
Gotha, Nuremberg, and in the possession of Count Esterhazy
at Nordkirchen, etc., but is the most beautiful because
of its perfect condition. Rembrandt, aged twenty-two or
twenty-three, is dressed in a somewhat fanciful costume and
wears a steel cuirass. The artistic way in which the light
falls and the management of the chiaroscuro foretells what
was destined to be Rembrandt's peculiarity of manner,
which Sir Joshua Reynolds has so happily described as "of
admitting but little light and giving to that little a wonderful
brilliancy." Bode says: "Although the brush work is broad,
the finish is strong. It stands out above all others of this
period; we feel already in this youthful work the paw of the
lion."</p>

<p><b>Rembrandt's Portraits of Himself.</b>&mdash;The artist was not
handsome; indeed he selected himself so often for a model
only for the sake of making a study of light and shade, etc.,
and because he had not always any other casual model than
himself at hand. As keen as the glance of his eyes is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
painting of this picture,&mdash;sharp, broad, but not so heavily
<i>impasto</i> as is the case a few years later.</p>

<p>At this period he painted many portraits of himself. The
Wallace Collection in London alone possesses two of the
master's self-studies, as does also the Berlin Picture-Gallery,
all of which are contemporary with this picture. The date
of this portrait is about 1634, when the artist was twenty-eight.
It is familiar to every one. Sir Joshua Reynolds
described it as "a portrait of a young man by Rembrandt,
dressed in a black cap and feathers, the upper part of the
face overshadowed; for coloring and force nothing can exceed
it."</p>

<p>Homer reciting his Poems (1663) represents an old man
in yellow robe. Part of the picture has suffered by having
been cut.</p>

<p><b>Van Ravesteyn (1572-1657).</b>&mdash;J. A. van Ravesteyn was
in The Hague what Rembrandt was in Amsterdam, Hals in
Haarlem, Mierevelt in Delft, Moreelse in Utrecht, and Cuijp
in Dordrecht. We have to thank him for the beautiful Shooting
Meetings in The Hague Gemeente Museum, and we also
have to thank him for a series of fine portraits full of character
of officers in the Mauritshuis. Although he had a
dangerous rival in Mierevelt, who was employed principally
by the Court of the Prince of Orange, yet Ravesteyn was
the official painter of The Hague. When the marksmen
wanted to have their portraits painted, or when the magistracy
wanted to be immortalized, it was Ravesteyn's brush
that had to undertake the work. He was not very highly
paid, in common with all other Dutch artists of that period.</p>

<p><b>Van Ravesteyn's Masterpiece.</b>&mdash;His great masterpiece,
the splendid shooting picture of 1618, the most important
one that had been painted up to that time in Holland,
brought him only 500 gulden; but in freeing him from all
guard duties and from beer and wine taxes, the rulers of The
Hague showed that they wanted to honor their artist.</p>

<p><b>Portraits by Van Ravesteyn.</b>&mdash;The portraits of this
magnificent portrait-painter are noble in conception and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
full of life and character; and in his first period were brilliant
in color. Indeed, the flesh tones of his first period
are even too red in his male portraits. Yet the pictures
which he painted before 1625-30 are stronger and more
full of spirit than the later pictures, which are cooler
and flatter in the tones and softer in the painting. There
is a series of twenty-three portraits of officers who are
unknown.</p>

<p><b>Pot's Sch&uuml;tzenst&uuml;ck.</b>&mdash;It was not until 1886 that the
great Sch&uuml;tzenst&uuml;ck, a Civic Guard picture in the Haarlem
Museum, which had always been so greatly admired by
critics, was discovered to be the long-lost picture painted
by Pot (1585-1657) in 1630, which had been falsely attributed
to Van der Helst. At the date when he painted
the picture Pot was so famous that the historiographer,
Ampzingh, had rhymed two years earlier, 1628, "then shall
also Hendrik Pot rightfully wear his crown. We wonder
what his busy hand is creating to-day." He calls the Allegory
of the Death of William I., the great Prince of Orange,
painted by Pot in 1620, and now unfortunately lost, "a
very fine and artistically painted picture." We have no
means of following his development, because his pictures
are rare, and seldom dated. The Hague picture shows us
a young gallant in bright green costume in the gay company
of three sirens and an old woman whose calling is unmistakable.
The young woman on his right is in violet; the
one on the left, in pink; and the third, in yellow and blue.
All this is in a strongly pronounced local color. The
drawing is careful and good. This is far superior in all
respects to a similar picture in the Berlin Gallery. The
background of this picture is a fine gray. The details are
convincingly and beautifully painted. The painting of the
high lights reminds us of the Hals School. The picture
was probably painted about 1630, and takes a commanding
place among the contemporary pictures of this style. It was
bought for 1300 gulden. A similar picture hangs in the
National Gallery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Two Portraits by Frans Hals.</b>&mdash;"The Government was
happily inspired," writes Mr. Bredius, "in 1881, when it bought
for The Hague Gallery two portraits by the great Frans Hals
[1580-1666], who had not been represented up till that time.
Yet there were and still are dissatisfied people who maintain
that the authorities ought to have tried to acquire a still better
example of the art of the master, these pictures of his being too
trifling and not worthy of the collection," etc. But people forgot
that such an opportunity does not often occur, and then that the
price is often so high that the slim purse of The Hague Gallery
makes a purchase not to be thought of.</p>

<p>"The smaller and more beautiful of the pair, the male portrait,
is quite capable of giving us a good idea of the virtuosity
of the portrait-painting of Hals. How fine, how self-assertive,
is the attitude of this twenty-nine-year-old patrician Haarlemite!
How sympathetically the costume is painted! How
well are the head and hands modelled and drawn! The portraits
were painted in the year 1625."</p></div>

<p>The portraits here described are of Jacob Olycan and his
wife, Aletta Hanemans.</p>

<p><b>Bode's Opinion of Hals's Pictures.</b>&mdash;In his celebrated
study of Hals of this period, Bode says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"About the year 1625 the master had advanced to a style of
impression and way of handling that in general remained stationary
for about ten years. A gay, delightful humor laughs
out at us from all these pictures: from the rich, full local colors,
the clear blonde tones, playful easy handling, which quickly, in
a few minutes with a few scattered strokes and sweeps of the
brush and palette knife blade, brings the personality of the
subject upon the canvas, and soon the conception is rendered to
the smallest detail in lovely, delicate completeness."</p></div>

<p><b>Characteristics of Thomas de Keijser's Work.</b>&mdash;Of all
important painters who flourished in Amsterdam when
Rembrandt settled there at the end of 1631, Thomas de
Keijser (1596-1667) was by far the greatest. His portraits,
particularly those of small dimensions, take high
rank among those which the Dutch school in its glory produced.
His work is distinguished by a masterly technique,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
a splendid characterization in portraiture, a powerful but
brilliant selection of color, and a broad, heavy brush.</p>

<p><b>Description of a Portrait painted by him.</b>&mdash;These
qualities are found in the Portrait of a Man of Distinction,
signed and dated 1631. The man, nearly life size, is
seated before a table covered with a reddish Oriental carpet,
and with his left hand is turning over the leaves of a
book that rests upon a desk. He is not looking at the
book, however, but at the spectator. His hair is gray and
quite short, he wears a moustache, his eyes are full of fire,
and his face is expressive. He has on a large black hat,
and a white collar spreads out over his black silk doublet;
his stockings are black silk, and his shoes are ornamented
with rosettes. The right hand, which is superb, rests on
his hip. The floor is paved with black and gray tiles and
in the sober background, which serves to bring out the
face, a library is indicated on the left.</p>

<p><b>Group of Four Burgomasters.</b>&mdash;The portrait is painted
on oak, as is also that of the Amsterdam Burgomasters
Deliberating with Regard to the Visit of Marie de M&eacute;dici
to that city. This very small picture, in which the figures
are only eight and a half inches high, was painted by De
Keijser in 1638, when the widow of the French King
Henri IV. visited Amsterdam.</p>

<p>"It is no small glory," says Blanc, "for De Keijser to
have painted a picture which in value of execution may be
placed between the Peace of M&uuml;nster and the Syndics by
Rembrandt."</p>

<p><b>Description of the Figures.</b>&mdash;Here we find four burgomasters
sitting around a table covered with a green cloth
in an austere hall, whose gray walls are broken by niches
containing statues. These four old men&mdash;Abraham Boom,
Petrus Hasselaer, Albert Coenraet Burgh, and Antonie Oetgens
van Waveren&mdash;are dressed in black and wear black
felt hats unadorned with plumes. Their grave deliberations
regarding the entertainment of the royal guest are interrupted
by the entrance of the lawyer, Cornelis van Davelaer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
who, hat in hand, salutes them with the greatest respect, as
he announces the arrival of Marie de M&eacute;dici.</p>

<p><b>Blanc's Opinion of the Picture.</b>&mdash;Blanc, who greatly
admires this picture, calls attention to the fact that no useless
piece of furniture or accessory of any kind disturbs
the solemnity of this little scene, which, on account of the
simple manner in which it is conceived, is great, notwithstanding
its size. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"With the exception of Rembrandt, I do not know of a
single Dutch painter, not even Van der Helst (who painted
such great canvases), who would not have belittled his picture,
either by elegance of touch and finish, or by the richness of
the costumes and arms, or by the effect of a carpet variegated
with a thousand shades. I imagine that Gerard Ter Borch, in
spite of his habitual dignity, would have found some pretext
for introducing into his composition a beautiful sword with a
baudrick, a crossbow, or a chandelier; that Metsu would certainly
have found some excuse for placing a richly chiselled
silver <i>aigui&egrave;re</i> or a golden goblet on the table; and I am sure
that through the door by which the lawyer, Davelaer, enters,
Pieter de Hooch would have let you see the antechamber of the
Council, with its high chairs covered with Utrecht velvet, or a
winding stairway, or a distant door opening into a garden or
street. The attention would then have been somewhat distracted
by the very striking accessories, or by the optical charm
of the chiaroscuro. Here we find nothing of the kind; not a
single concession to conventional treatment. By the gravity of
their attitude, we see that these four citizens, chosen by a free
people who sit here with covered heads, express in themselves
the majesty of the United Provinces, and they consider themselves
of equal rank with the Queen of France, whose arrival
is being announced; you feel at once that they bring a plebeian
pride to their magnificent reception of that princess
who was, like them, originally from a republic of merchants.
All the costumes being black,&mdash;that beautiful, warm, transparent,
silky black peculiar to Velasquez and Anthonis Moro,&mdash;you
only notice in this picture the hands and the heads. The
heads have an expression that will remain engraven in the
mind forever, for the painter has accented them so deeply, and
brought into contrast both physical and moral features. Notwithstanding
their individuality, they all have a certain grandeur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
The peculiar trait of this master, however, is the neutral background,
the exquisite sobriety of the tone of the wall, recalling
the beautiful gray of the great Spanish painter; and from this
stand out the black of the doublets and the white collars."</p></div>

<p>Blanc also calls attention to the splendid painting of the
faces: the eyes sunken by age, the wrinkles of the skin, and
the withered cheeks. Bredius writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What character has the artist put into these heads! We
feel at once that it must have been this kind of men who conducted
Amsterdam to greatness and fame. What worth and
dignity in the way they hold themselves! What self-confidence
in the proud glance!"</p></div>

<p><b>Other Portraits in the Mauritshuis.</b>&mdash;Of other notable
portraits in the Mauritshuis there are three by Moreelse
(one of himself); six by Honthorst, including one of a
child gathering fruit, originally in the Castle of Honsholredijk;
nine by Mierevelt (chiefly of various Princes of
Orange); three by Ravesteyn, one a group; two by Moro,
one of a goldsmith, the other supposed to be Prince
William I. in his youth; three by Netscher; Ter Borch's
of himself; two by Frans van Mieris; one by Cuijp, and
other examples by Rubens and Van Dijck.</p>

<p><b>Ferdinand Bol's Pay for Portraits.</b>&mdash;Of Rembrandt's
numerous pupils, one of the most eminent in portraiture
was Ferdinand Bol (1616-80), whose earliest signed
work is dated 1642. In his earliest period he devoted
himself chiefly to large pictures of Biblical subjects; but,
like many other artists, he very soon found that there was
a great deal more money to be made in portraiture. At
that time, when photography was unknown, it was only
natural that everybody who could afford it had his picture
painted. From the burgomaster to the ordinary tailor or
skipper&mdash;all wanted to have pictures of themselves and
their families hanging on their own walls; and the purchaser
could indulge himself in this natural vanity at comparatively
small cost, for the demand naturally increased the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
supply; and there were only too many painters who were
glad enough to serve their patrons. As the artists became
famous their prices naturally increased; and some received
higher pay than others who to-day have a greater reputation.
Rembrandt probably received as much as anybody
else for a time; but at the end of his life there was a
greater demand for portraits by others, such as Maes, who
were more pliant to the changing mode. Rembrandt received
500 gulden each for his famous portraits, whilst
others were content with 150, 100, and even 30 or 40
gulden. Caspar Netscher, for instance, received only from
50 to 70 gulden for his elegantly finished pictures. The
usual custom was for an artist to paint portraits for a living,
meanwhile working and developing himself along the lines
of his special genius. Thus we find several of the Little
Masters practically relinquishing portraiture as soon as they
had made a big reputation in <i>genre</i>, or other fields.</p>

<p><b>Bol's Work in Portraiture.</b>&mdash;Bol was a portrait-painter
exclusively; he married first in 1653, and a second time
in 1669. Probably both wives belonged to rich and important
families, for Bol was kept busy his whole life long
and became wealthy, dying in 1680 in his beautiful house
with its fine grounds and stables.</p>

<p>With him, as with so many other successful painters, his
last pictures were not his best. In his earlier portraits he
represents his sitters in beautiful chiaroscuro. The painting
is broad and spirited; the color strong and brilliant. He
painted so much in Rembrandt's style at first that many
of Bol's pictures have been taken for those of his master;
and later, when Bol's reputation had faded, unscrupulous
dealers did not hesitate to change his signature on the
canvases for that of Rembrandt. A celebrated instance
of this practice is the so-called Portrait of Flinck and his
Wife in Munich, which by many connoisseurs was long
admired as Rembrandt's work; but, by Hauser's skill, the
false Rembrandt signature was obliterated and the real one
of Bol brought to light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Bol's Portrait of De Ruyter's Son.</b>&mdash;The Mauritshuis
owns one of the best portraits by Bol, painted in his later
period, that of the handsome twenty-year-old son of the
great Admiral de Ruyter. This son, Engel de Ruyter, was
born in 1649 and died in 1683. Bol painted him in the
year 1669, as may be seen by the date on the picture.
It is only quite recently that the pendant, a portrait of the
great Admiral de Ruyter, has come to be regarded as a copy
after Bol. The charming little marine in the picture is undoubtedly
by the hand of Willem <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins> the younger,
and adds greatly to the interest of the painting because it is
of itself a fine picture of that great master. In many of his
later portraits, Bol is somewhat dull in his color and painted
them too rapidly, besides giving to his flesh too strong a
red-rose tint; but that cannot be said of him in this case,
where he has done his very best. In particular, he has
handled the rich costume with affectionate and masterful
touch.</p>

<span class="caption">F. BOL<br />

</div>

<p><b>Description of the Sitter.</b>&mdash;The genial countenance,
which displays none of the real martial type of his celebrated
father, rises finely out of the red drapery. The
bearing is elegant, though perhaps there is a little too
much pose in it. The portrait is particularly interesting,
because the sitter had a career of great promise which was
cut short all too soon. Nine years after the portrait was
painted, the youth had already risen to the rank of Vice-Admiral
and had been created a Spanish count, having
also refused the title of duke; but before he had attained
thirty-four years of age, he died, not a hero's death like his
father, as he had desired, but in his own luxurious dwelling
in Amsterdam. However, he had already while very
young fought valiantly beside his father in the Battle of
Solebay.</p>

<p><b>A Picture by Salomon Koninck.</b>&mdash;Another pupil of
Rembrandt whom we shall see in the Rijks is G. van den
Eeckhout. A picture formerly attributed to him, the Adoration
of the Magi, is now known to be by Salomon Koninck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
(1618-88). One of the Magi in a red cloak is kneeling
before the Infant Jesus and another on the right wears a
golden mantle. The color is vigorous and the work shows
the knowledge of chiaroscuro for which Rembrandt's school
was so famous.</p>

<p><b>Two Pictures by Nicholas Maes.</b>&mdash;Nicholas Maes
(1632-93) is represented in the Mauritshuis by only two
pictures,&mdash;one of them of questionable origin, moreover;
and therefore the student must go to Amsterdam for varied
examples of his work. The portrait here is that of the
Grand Pensionary, Jakob Cats, an original replica of which
hangs in the Budapesth gallery. Diana and Her Nymphs
shows some of the qualities to be expected of one who
worked in Rembrandt's studio for eighteen years; but it is
now sometimes attributed to Vermeer of Delft. The signature,
"N. M. 1650," is said to be false.</p>

<p><b>Maes's Work as a Portrait-Painter.</b>&mdash;Maes was a pupil
of Rembrandt and became a very successful portrait-painter
by copying the master's style. He soon became rich by
his talents, his wit, his polished manners, and by flattering
his sitters. He charged high prices for his pictures; and
he deserved his great reputation. The chiaroscuro of his
paintings is very vigorous. If the shadows are not heavily
massed as with Rembrandt, they are at least strongly accented;
and, as the half-tones are very summary, the passage
from light to dark is very brusque, and by this means
the painter attains a powerful effect and strong relief.</p>

<p><b>His Visit to Jordaens at Antwerp.</b>&mdash;Having become
rich, and getting tired of everlastingly painting the rich
burghers of Amsterdam and their wives, Maes thought he
would like to go to see the works of the great artists of
Antwerp, who at that time were so much talked about
throughout Europe. Having been initiated into the high
freemasonry of art by Rembrandt, he was cordially received
by the Antwerp painters and soon recognized by
them as a brother. Among others, he went to visit Jordaens
and was shown into a room filled with pictures, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
he examined while awaiting the appearance of the latter,
who was watching his visitor through the keyhole. When
he entered, Jordaens said: "I see plainly that you are a
great connoisseur, or perhaps an able painter, for the best
pictures in my gallery detained you longer than the others."</p>

<p>Maes simply replied, "I am a portrait-painter."</p>

<p>"In that case," replied Jordaens, "I sincerely pity you.
So you also are one of those martyrs of painting who so
richly deserve our commiseration!"</p>

<p>In fact, Maes's weariness at having to put up with the
whims of human vanity probably had much to do with his
turning to <i>genre</i>, by which he is now best known and for
which he is most highly prized.</p>

<p><b>Maes's Pictures of Familiar Scenes.</b>&mdash;The average art-lover,
however, cares little for the portraiture of Maes, but
prizes him as a painter of familiar scenes, like Pieter de
Hooch. Although less varied and less supple, but not less
robust than the latter, Maes was his equal in the power of
his effects. The triviality of the subject which he often
selects is relieved by the charm of an astonishingly vigorous
and spirited execution. Burger says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On passing through a kitchen, perhaps, you see an old
woman scraping carrots, having various kitchen utensils about
her. If you have seen this humble interior in one of Maes's
pictures, it will be impossible for you not to halt and spend
some time in looking at it. The painting of Nicholas Maes is
one of those that become encrusted in the memory. The light
gleams in it, the canvas glows, the subject stands out, the eye
runs over it, and if the figures were of natural size one would
go forward to meet them, so strong is the impression, so solid
is the tone, so palpable, and modelled in relief are the forms.</p>

<p>"In his little familiar scenes, Maes is not always insignificant
or vulgar in his choice of subject. Most often, indeed, his
composition is ingenious, witty, and piquant. In the first place,
it is set in the most picturesque corner of the room; the painter
likes to take up his position in a place whence he can see at
once the house from top to bottom,&mdash;both the stairs descending
to the cellar and those mounting to the first floor. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the figures he brings into the scene usually have some malicious
trick to play, some secret conversation to overhear, some theft
to discover, or some infidelity to discover."</p></div>

<p><b>Samuel van <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Hoogstraten,' 'Hoogstraaten,' and 'Hooghstraten' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hoogstraaten</ins>.</b>&mdash;It is singular how few pictures
are known by Rembrandt's remarkable pupil, Samuel
van Hoogstraaten (1625-78), a versatile painter of
landscapes, portraits, marines, architecture, fruits, flowers,
and, more particularly, interiors, in which he followed Pieter
de Hooch. In his Lady in a Vestibule he has demonstrated
his knowledge of perspective, of which he was very proud.
The chief feature of the picture, however, is the beautiful
chiaroscuro, for which he has to thank Rembrandt's
teaching. The lady is walking in a portico of very fine
architecture, and reading. With one hand she is holding
up her straw-colored dress. This figure is only two
feet high, while the spaniel that accompanies her is life
size!</p>

<p><b>Effects of Rembrandt's Teaching on his Pupils.</b>&mdash;Thirty
of Rembrandt's pupils made great names for themselves
by copying that great master in one or other of his manners.
Some made a system of what with him was merely
a mood or caprice. Not being able to follow him in the
expression of the human soul, they made a specialty, some
of portraiture, some of costume, some of chiaroscuro, some
of <i>genre</i>, and some of landscape.</p>

<p><b>Philip Koninck's Landscapes.</b>&mdash;Philip Koninck (1619-88)
is almost the only pupil of Rembrandt who painted
landscapes almost exclusively, and he listened to the teachings
of his master with great docility. His principle was
to regard nature from a little distance, so as to grasp
the masses, rather than to enter into details. The
Mauritshuis possesses a beautiful and characteristic specimen
of his genius. In composition and treatment, it reminds
us of Rembrandt's Landscape of the Three Trees.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Blanc says:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among the Dutch landscape painters perhaps there is not
one, unless it is Van der Hagen, who would have dared to paint
this monotonous plain, all the lines of which are horizontal, all
the clumps and rows of trees of the same height, and in which
the only objects in the foreground are a cottage half hidden
among trees, and, a little farther on, a low sandy hill which
does not rise beyond the level of the middle distance. The
vast stretch of country is traversed by so many courses of water
that it almost looks as if it were threatened with an inundation.
The meadows are on a level with the sea; the distant villages
look like flotillas at anchor, and the houses seem to be floating
on the canals. The painter has placed his point of view so high
that neither the sails of the windmills, nor the points of the belfries,
nor the tops of the highest trees stand out against the sky.
The picture is cut in half by the almost straight line of a horizon
which gradually recedes until lost to view, and the towns
we perceive in the distance, the rows of trees, the hamlets, and
rivers all run parallel with this horizon. That is to say, that
Philip Koninck (and this picture resembles all the others of his
we know) is conceived entirely at variance with the ideas that
are generally held regarding the picturesque."</p></div>

<p>Gilpin says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'The greatest enemies of the picturesque are the symmetry
of the forms, the resemblance and parallelism of the lines, the
polish of the surfaces, and the uniformity of the colors.'</p>

<p>"Very well! Here is a landscape by Koninck that fulfils all
the conditions of the non-picturesque; and which, nevertheless,
produces a certain impression of grandeur and sadness, solely
by means of the canvas being furrowed into infinite depths, the
gradations of the perspective being extremely well observed,
and the uniformity of the ground being happily contrasted with
a sky full of movement, a fine disorder of clouds which the
breeze slowly drives before it as a shepherd does his flock."</p></div>

<p><b>Dutch Painters who imitated Italians.</b>&mdash;Rembrandt,
although he arose at a time when the influence of Italian
art was supreme, never went to Rome; nevertheless, he
owed a great deal to the studies of those artists who had
been there. The Hague Gallery contains several pictures
of this period; and these are sufficient to give us a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
good idea of the qualities of Dutch art just before Rembrandt,
in 1629, set up for himself in Amsterdam at the
age of twenty-one.</p>

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Henricus' and 'Hendrik' Goltzius were used in this text. This was retained.">Hendrik</ins> Goltzius.</b>&mdash;An influential founder of a large
school of painters who modelled themselves on the great
Italians was Hendrik Goltzius (1558-1616). He started for
Rome in 1590, and indulged to the full his intense admiration
for <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Michelangelo' and 'Michael Angelo' were used in this text. This was retained.">Michelangelo</ins>, which led him to surpass that master
in the extravagance of his designs. The works by his own
hand he most valued were his eccentric imitations of the
designs of Michelangelo. His portraits show exquisite
finish, and are fine studies of character. The beauty and
freedom of his execution make amends for his extravagance.
In the Mauritshuis are three pictures painted shortly before
he died&mdash;Mercury, Hercules, and Minerva.</p>

<p><b>His Academy at Haarlem.</b>&mdash;On his return from Italy
Mander, who was a great friend of Goltzius, induced him to
open an academy at Haarlem, in combination with Mander
and Cornelisz, and with the assistance of his old pupils,
Matham, M&uuml;ller, Sanraedam, and De Gheyn, as professors.
As might be expected, Italian taste predominated in this
academy, not solely on account of the personal preference
of the founders, but because the Italian style had been
popularized in the Low Countries by Lambert Lombard,
and his pupils, Hubert Golz, Lambert Zutman, Dominic
Lampson, William Key, and Frans Floris (1518-70). Of
these the most famous was Floris, who also studied in
Italy, and himself founded a large school. The Hague
possesses in Venus and Adonis a charming example of his
style.</p>

<p><b>The Italian Style followed by Cornelisz.</b>&mdash;Cornelis
Cornelisz (1562-1638) had never been to Italy, but his
education and environment had given him Italian tendencies.
We learn that even after he had attained proficiency
he never dispensed with the model; nevertheless, he was
neither a slavish imitator of nature, nor altogether a painter
of style. He has two large pictures in The Hague Gallery that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
were painted about the time he joined Goltzius in the Haarlem
academy. These are the Massacre of the Innocents
(1591) and the Marriage of Peleus and Thetis (1593).
The dominating idea of the artist in the Massacre of the
Innocents, which covers a canvas 8-3/4 by 8-1/4 feet, is the
wish to appear a great master of drawing by curves and
modeling that exaggerate the relief of the muscles. There
are more than two hundred figures which are almost all
entirely nude. The executioners, and the infants in particular,
show an attempt at noble form which rises above
nothing more than affectation. There is an obvious striving
after the genius of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Michelangelo' and 'Michael Angelo' were used in this text. This was retained.">Michelangelo</ins> which, in the Dutch
master, is merely pretentious imitation of what would be
facile and superb in the great Florentine. There is not a
single attitude nor a movement that is not <i>contrasted</i>; for
instance, if the left arm is behind, the right leg is in front.
In fact, the study of nature is completely subordinated to
academic conventions. The color is far more natural than
the drawing. The artist has been extremely successful in
rendering the flesh tints of life as well as of death, and he
has varied the <i>nuances</i> in accordance with sex and age,
giving very faithfully the tenderness and freshness of the
flesh tints of infancy, and the softness of the female form,
the stronger tones of the executioners in action, and even
the cadaverous hue of the bloodless corpses. As for the
expressions of the faces, they are vulgar though energetic.</p>

<p><b>His Love of painting the Nude.</b>&mdash;The love of Cornelisz
for compositions thronged with nude figures in the most
varied attitudes wherein he could exhibit all the resources
of his learning and study of the works of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Michelangelo' and 'Michael Angelo' were used in this text. This was retained.">Michelangelo</ins> is
again shown in the large canvas, measuring 8 by 14 feet,
entitled Banquet of the Gods of Olympus, or Marriage of
Peleus and Thetis.</p>

<p><b>Gilles Coignet.</b>&mdash;Cornelisz had received his tastes and
instruction principally from Gilles Coignet (1540-99),
who set out for Italy with another painter named Stello in
1555 and worked principally at Terni, between Loretto and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Rome, for five years. He painted historical and mythological
subjects of easel size, but was more successful in landscapes,
and more particularly in candle-light subjects and
moonlight. He took up his abode in Amsterdam in 1586.
His influence on the Haarlem school was pronounced.</p>

<p><b>Elsheimer's Excellence in Chiaroscuro.</b>&mdash;The Mauritshuis
possesses two Italian Landscapes by Adam Elsheimer
(Elshaimer or Elzheimer) (1574-1620), a German painter,
whom the Italians call Adam Tedesco, who possessed great
influence over his contemporaries, particularly the elder
Teniers and Rembrandt, who followed out the same characteristics
of chiaroscuro. Elsheimer delighted in the effects
of moonlight and evening dusk; also in torchlight, conflagrations,
and every other kind of artificial light,&mdash;all of
which he represented with greater excellence than had ever
been done before him. Visiting Italy, he became charmed
with the country and settled in Rome, where his little pictures,
usually painted on copper with microscopic and
beautifully finished figures, had great success. Elsheimer
was visited by all the artists of his country, including Poelemburg,
who saw him in 1617. He was almost as great
in chiaroscuro as Rembrandt; and his immense reputation
did not diminish until after the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><b>Cornelis van Poelemburg.</b>&mdash;A picture of Women
Bathing, by Cornelis van Poelemburg (1586-1667), is a
fine example of his style. He studied first under Bloemaert,
but during a protracted visit to Italy he fell under
the influence of Elsheimer; and on his return to his own
country he became quite the rage as a painter of classic landscape.
In Rome he had been fascinated by Raphael's
pictures, and studied him with affectionate admiration.
Poelemburg possessed a happy and tranquil nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>His Attractive Landscapes.</b>&mdash;"The little pictures that his
imagination painted breathe a quiet happiness, and are imprinted
with a suave poesy. They nearly always represent a
countryside adorned with ancient ruins and frequented by
demi-nude nymphs. His landscapes, enveloped in vapor which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
while decreasing the dryness of the outlines and crudity of the
tones, would soften the aspect of the most rugged spots, serve
as a background for the whiteness of the goddesses who dance
with fauns or repose in the shade of some abandoned monument.
Sometimes, as though the vale that they dwell in were reserved
for the gods, Poelemburg's nymphs do not fear to remove their
light vesture and bathe in some open pool where only the
painter may see them. But, most frequently, it is in the neighborhood
of a grotto, at the foot of rocks perpetually washed by a
spring of fresh water, that one likes to surprise them, nude,
trembling, their bodies rendered whiter by the transparent veil
of the atmosphere, playing with the water they are disturbing,
swimming after one another and half-hidden by the current of
their chaste fountains."</p></div>

<p><b>Dutch Artists who migrated to Rome.</b>&mdash;Bartholomeus
Breenborch (1599-1659) was another member of that band
of artists who at the beginning of the seventeenth century
deserted the banks of the Meuse for those of the Tiber,
and exchanged the land that was to produce Rembrandt
for the country of Raphael's birth. A few Dutch artists
successfully resisted the lures of the Eternal City; but the
majority of painters of that period followed the example of
Elsheimer, Poelemburg, Karel Dujardin, Herman Swanevelt,
Andreas and Jan Both, and others, and formed a
little Dutch colony among the Seven Hills.</p>

<p><b>Breenborch compared with Poelemburg.</b>&mdash;Breenborch
devoted himself to history and landscape alternately. His
historical subjects were chiefly Biblical and mythological.
He was fond of painting classical landscapes with ruins;
and the only artist who could excel him in painting charming
little figures in a landscape was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">Van de Velde</ins>. The
chief characteristic of Poelemburg, with whom Breenborch
is so often compared, is grace. The only picture of this
artist in The Hague Gallery, Mercury appearing to the
Nymph Hers&eacute;, resembles Poelemburg both in subject and
treatment.</p>

<p><b>Van der Ulft's Architectural Paintings.</b>&mdash;Van der Ulft
(1627-90), another artist of this school, was originally a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
painter on glass. Later, he turned to historical compositions
of small dimensions; but his real talent lay in the
representation of architectural monuments, and scenes inside
city walls. It is strange that he never visited Italy,
but formed himself by the study of the works of returning
Roman art pilgrims and of engravings. His perspective
is exact; his ancient ruins, triumphal arches,
and statues are correctly placed in his pictures, and his
architectural backgrounds, abounding in strong and golden
grays, form an excellent frame for the little figures that
animate his spirited paintings. He delighted to paint
Roman processions. The Hague picture shows an army
on the march in a landscape adorned with architectural
remains.</p>

<p><b>Nicolas <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Moeyaert' and 'Moijaert' were used in this text. This was retained.">Moeyaert</ins>'s Best Points.</b>&mdash;A follower of Elsheimer,
who later became a disciple of Rembrandt, was
Nicolas Moeyaert (1630-?), who settled in Amsterdam
in 1624 and joined the Painters' Guild in 1630. In some
of his pictures he imitated Rembrandt very closely. He
excelled in portraits, animals, landscapes, and historical
and Biblical scenes. The Hague Gallery contains three:
Mercury appearing to the Nymph Hers&eacute;; Triumph of
Silenus, and a Biblical scene, also called the Visit of
Antiochus to the Augur.</p>

The Visit of Antiochus to the Augur</span>
</div>

<p><b>Description of one of his Pictures.</b>&mdash;Antiochus, about to
engage in a war, is consulting the augur. In the centre stands
the king dressed in a long blue robe, with a white girdle
and a purple cloak lined with fur; also a furred bonnet.
He is talking to an old man, the augur, who has a long
white beard. He is wrapped in a yellow cloak, is barefooted,
and he is writing in a book. By him are some animals,
including a dog and some rabbits, and on the right of
Antiochus are two goats and a sheep. On a rock on the
left is a group of ten persons; and in the centre of the picture
between the two high rocks stand a tower and a temple.
For pupils <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Moeyaert' and 'Moijaert' were used in this text. This was retained.">Moeyaert</ins> had Berchem, Van der Does,
Salomon Koninck, and J. B. Weenix.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Pieters and Lastman.</b>&mdash;Gerrit Pieters, the best pupil
of C. Cornelisz, also went to Rome. He painted assemblies,
<i>genre</i>, and small portraits; his success prevented him
from devoting himself to historical painting, which he preferred.
A pupil of his was Pieter Lastman (1583-1633),
who also made a long sojourn in Italy under Elsheimer's
influence. He groped about in different styles for a
long time, devoting himself principally to Biblical subjects.
He learned a good deal about light effects from
Elsheimer; on his return he imparted what he knew to
Rembrandt, who studied with him for a short time. Later,
when his brilliant pupil grew famous, Lastman humbly followed
his lead. Jan <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Lievens' and 'Lievensz' were used in this text. This was retained.">Lievens</ins> (1607-74), was another of
his pupils. A picture by him, painted in 1622, when Rembrandt
was still only fourteen years old, and therefore could
not have influenced him, is in the Mauritshuis. It is called
The Resurrection of Lazarus.</p>

<p>An artist who accompanied Lastman to Italy in 1605
was named Jan Pinas (f. 1608-21). He painted portraits,
landscapes, and historical subjects.</p>

<p><b>Herman Swanevelt's Study of Nature.</b>&mdash;Herman Swanevelt
(Herman of Italy) (1600-55) was a pupil and imitator
of Claude Lorraine in Rome, whither he went in 1624, and
where his excessive application to study gained for him
the name of "the Hermit" from the band of Dutch and
German artists established in that city. Unlike Claude, with
whom he used to walk in the environs of Rome, and who
never sketched from nature, Swanevelt always had his pencil
in his hand, taking note of all that he saw, studying the
oaks and large plants, and copying the buildings, campaniles,
and vine-wreathed arcades and ruins. He left nothing
to his imagination. While Claude's landscapes speak
of the Golden Age, Swanevelt's are actual reproductions of
the country as he saw it. His buildings are not imaginary
villas, temples, and palaces, but are the Roman ruins and
the fa&ccedil;ades and cloisters that he knew. In his arrangement
and composition he resembled Claude; and, like him, often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
placed in the corner of his picture wooded mountains or
large trees, and sometimes even placed them in the very
centre to make a striking contrast to the very light background.</p>

<p>Naturally rude and savage, Swanevelt contributed some
of his character to his work. He liked bold mountains
clothed with dark forests, deep ravines, solitary places, and
torrents bounding from the rocks; and he understood how
to mingle the heroic style with rural beauty.</p>

<p>Two Italian landscapes, one dated 1650, the other
formerly attributed to Claude Lorraine, hang in the
Mauritshuis.</p>

<p><b>J. van Swanenburch.</b>&mdash;Rembrandt spent three years
in the studio of J. van Swanenburch (d. 1638), who had
finished his studies at Rome, and worked in Naples for
a long time, returning to Holland in 1617.</p>

<p><b>Bloemaert, Founder of the School of Utrecht.</b>&mdash;Abraham
Bloemaert (1564-1651) constitutes in many respects
the link of transition with the succeeding epoch; for however
his frequent mannerisms and gaudy coloring betray
the tasteless period in which he was born, his later pictures
show a power, taste, and broader touch. He painted a
great number of religious and mythological subjects, portraits,
landscapes, and animals. By reason of his talent
and his long life (ninety-two years), he exercised great
influence over the School of Utrecht, and may be regarded
as its founder.</p>

<p><b>Some of his Pupils.</b>&mdash;Among his principal pupils may
be mentioned: J. and A. Both, the Honthorsts, J. B. Weenix,
Knupfer, Cornelis van Poelemburg, and the father of Albert
Cuijp. Two pictures painted in the prime of his life are in
The Hague Gallery; they deserve attention if only for their
size and the number of figures they contain. The subjects
are: Hippomenes receiving the Prize (signed and dated
1626), and the Marriage of Peleus (signed and dated 1628).
The latter was carried off by the French, but returned after
1815.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Description of the Marriage of Peleus and Thetis.</b>&mdash;"It
is composed of fourteen large figures, half nude, representing
the gods of Olympus celebrating the marriage of Thetis.
Seated at table and distinguished by their divine attributes, the
gods appear to be troubled at the sight of Discord, who descends
from above, borne on a cloud, and throws down among
them the golden apple destined for the most beautiful. In the
foreground, with her back turned to the spectator, is shown the
figure of Venus, who displays unveiled her divine shoulders, her
voluptuous neck, and her incomparably beautiful body, which
will carry off the prize, and which has no need of the girdle of
beauty to render the goddess beloved. Elsewhere than in The
Hague Gallery this mythological painting would perhaps not
excite more remark than any other picture, but there, in the
midst of a family, <i>bourgeoise</i>, and Protestant school, which
avoids the nude and ignores academic conventions and style,
a picture of this kind cannot fail strongly to attract attention.
Abraham Bloemaert, like the famous Cornelis of Haarlem, has
the air of an Italian who has gone astray in these northern
regions. These noble contours and learned lines, this modelling
of the flesh pursued with a certain pedanticism by the
former, and with grace and facility by the latter, and finally
these more or less violent foreshortenings,&mdash;those, for instance,
offered by this picture in the figures of Discord and
the Loves who scatter flowers or suspend from trees the curtain
that decorates the place of banqueting,&mdash;all this is at
variance with the jollity and naturalism of the Dutch; all this
betrays the influence of a foreign style, an influence that reigned
in Holland in the sixteenth century, disappeared at the arrival
of Rembrandt, and did not return till the appearance of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'G&eacute;rard' and 'Gerard' de Lairesse were used in this text. This was retained.">G&eacute;rard</ins>

<p><b>Others who painted in the Italian Style.</b>&mdash;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Nicholas' and 'Nicolaes' Berchem were used in this text. This was retained.">Nicholas</ins>
(or Claes) Berchem (1620-83), Karel Dujardin (1622-78),
and Jan (or Johannes) Both (1610-52), painted in
the Italian style. Berchem was a pupil of his father,
Pieter Claes, and of J. B. Weenix, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Moeyaert' and 'Moijaert' were used in this text. This was retained.">Moeyaert</ins>, Pieter de
Grebber, and probably Jan van Goyen. Karel Dujardin
was a pupil of Berchem. All three travelled in Italy; and
all three are represented in The Hague Gallery. Berchem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
has an Italian Landscape and Figures; an Italian Landscape
or Pastoral (dated 1648), with life-sized figures.</p>

<p><b>Berchem's Picture of a Boar-Hunt.</b>&mdash;A Wild Boar Hunt,
of the year 1659, shows that he could successfully treat an
animated scene. Crowe says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is a model of precision combined with elegance of execution;
though at the same time that blue dark tone which, to
the eye of a connoisseur, so much detracts from the value of
his later works, already partially appears. This is more seen
in a landscape dated 1661 in the same museum, though otherwise
belonging to his more attractive works. But here also the
conventional and monotonous treatment of his cattle begins to
be visible.... But the most striking example of the master's
deterioration is afforded us by one of his latest works, the Cavalry
Engagement, in The Hague Museum, which is a very type
of crude and discordant effect and hardness of detail."</p></div>

<p>His fourth picture is An Italian Quay, dated 1661.</p>

<p><b>Pictures by Dujardin, Jan Both, and Others.</b>&mdash;Karel
Dujardin, famous for his animals, portraits, and landscapes,
can be well studied in a fine Italian landscape, called A
Cascade in Italy, rich and warm in tone and dated 1673.</p>

<p>Johannes Both has two Italian landscapes, one of which
glows with sunshine and is remarkable for breadth and
delicacy.</p>

<p>Other pictures showing this Italian influence are The Ambuscade
and an Italian landscape by Moucheron, with
figures by J. Lingelbach; the Terrestrial Paradise by Jan
Brueghel the Elder; and The Torrent, by Adam Pynacker.</p>

<p><b>Adam Pynacker and Jan Both compared.</b>&mdash;Pynacker,
though inferior to Jan Both in his Italian landscapes, surpasses
him in variety. His tone is cooler than Both's, and
he excels in painting early morning scenes. In addition to
pastoral scenes, he loves rocky heights, mountain ranges,
Italian harbors, bold bridges, and waterfalls.</p>

<p>Pynacker enlivened his landscapes with human figures
and cattle, both of which he was able to draw and paint extremely
well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Albert Cuijp's Portrait of Sieur de Roovere.</b>&mdash;The
famous Albert Cuijp (1620-91) belongs to this group,
being a pupil of his father, Jacob <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both Jacob 'Gerritz' and 'Gerritsz' Cuijp were used in this text. This was retained.">Gerritsz</ins> Cuijp, who was a
pupil of Abraham Bloemaert.</p>

<p>There is but one Cuijp in the Mauritshuis, Portrait of
Sieur de Roovere directing the salmon fishery near Dordrecht,
which need not detain us long, for we shall find more
interesting examples of this master in the Rijks. Burger
calls this A View in the Environs of Dordrecht, and says it
is "a beautiful painting, but perhaps a little brusque." A
gentleman wearing a black hat with red plumes and mounted
on a bay horse, is seen on the left, to whom a fisherman in
heavy boots is offering fish. On the right lies a spaniel.
In the middle distance are some fishermen, a black horse,
the other side of a canal, and a house. The two principal
figures are about a foot high.</p>

<p><b>The Beginning of the School of Dutch Landscape.</b>&mdash;Jan
Hackaert (1629-99) forms a connecting link between
those painters who represent Northern and those who represent
Southern scenery. He travelled when young into
Germany and Switzerland. The Hague has a good example
of an Italian landscape with figures by Lingelbach; but
better examples of his work are in the Rijks. This brings
us to the beginning of the great school of Dutch landscape,
when the painters began to take an interest in the scenery
of their own country. Two great names are Jan van Goyen
(1596-1666) and Jan Wijnants (1600-77), important not
only because of their own productions, but because they
were the first painters of Dutch landscape, and each had
followers and pupils who attained great fame.</p>

<p>Jan van Goyen was a pupil of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Esais' and 'Esaias' van de Velde were used in this text.

<p><b>Characteristics of Van Goyen's Works.</b>&mdash;Jan van
Goyen was fortunate in being the son of an amateur of
painting, who encouraged his talent. After studying with
various artists of no special reputation, he travelled in
France and on his return studied with <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Esais' and 'Esaias' van de Velde were used in this text.

He is always simple in painting and manner. Ordinarily he
selects tranquil river scenes on which merchant ships or
fishing-boats are quietly sailing. You often see hamlets on
piles, and, very frequently, the steeple of a church, standing
out in picturesque contrast to the horizon line. Sometimes
a ruined tower forms the chief motive of his composition.</p>

<p><b>His Marines and Watery Landscapes.</b>&mdash;One of the principal
characteristics of Van Goyen's marines and landscapes
is their peacefulness, calmness, and slight touch of sadness.
It is not the sadness inspired by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>'s groves, but a
gentle melancholy feeling that touches the imagination and
induces dreams. The sun never appears in Van Goyen's
pictures. Humid clouds veil his skies, which in their light
portions have the silvery tones of Teniers. His beach or
shore is generally enveloped in a grayish mist, and in the
moving clouds you feel the breath of wind and fancy you
hear it sigh. His long flat surface, so dull and solitary,
is animated only by a fishing-boat or a shallop. Holland,
because of its water-ways, is a silent country and the impression
of silence and peace is marvellously reproduced in
Van Goyen's pictures. He never allows a brilliant tone to
disturb the uniformity and harmony of his watery landscapes;
but behind the clouds that float across the sky you
divine the far-away sun, like a light behind a curtain. The
famous View of the City of Dordrecht, by the latter, signed
and dated 1634, is a splendid example of his qualities and
style.</p>

<p><b>His Illustrious Pupils.</b>&mdash;After his marriage, Van Goyen
established himself in Leyden, his native town, where he

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>The Greatest of the Dutch Landscape-Painters.</b>&mdash;"Jacob
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins> (1628-82) is beyond all dispute the greatest
of the Dutch landscape-painters. In the works of no other do
we find that feeling for the poetry of Northern nature and perfection
united in the same degree. With admirable drawing he
combined a knowledge of chiaroscuro in its most multifarious
aspects, a coloring powerful and warm, and a mastery of the
brush, which, while never too smooth in surface, ranges from
the tenderest and most minute touch to the broadest, freest, and
most marrowy execution. The prevailing tone of his coloring
is a full, decided green. Unfortunately, however, many of his
pictures have, in the course of years, acquired a heavy brown
tone, and thus forfeited their highest charm. Many also were
originally painted in a grayish but clear tone."</p>

<p><b>His Favorite Subjects.</b>&mdash;"He generally presents us with
the flat and homely scenery of his native country under the
conditions of repose; while the usually heavy clouded sky,
which tells either of a shower just past or one impending, and
dark sheets of water overshadowed by trees, impart a melancholy
character to his pictures. Especially does he delight in
representing a wide expanse of land or water. If the former,
the scene is frequently taken from some elevation in the surrounding
country, commanding a view of his native city, Haarlem,
which is seen breaking the line of the horizon with its
spires.</p>

<p>"Taken altogether, his wide expanses of sky, earth, or sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
with their tender gradations of a&euml;rial perspective, diversified
here and there by alternations of sunshine and shadow, may be
said to attract us as much by the deep pathos as well as picturesqueness
of their character. On the other hand, we often find
the great master taking pleasure in the representation of hilly
and even mountainous districts, with foaming waterfalls, in
which he has won some of his greatest triumphs; or he gives
us a bare pile of rock, with a dark lake at its base; but these
latter subjects, which embody the feeling of the most elevated
melancholy, occur very rarely. In his drawing of men and
animals he was weak, and occasionally obtained the assistance
of other masters, especially of A. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins> and
Berchem."</p>

<p><b>Difference between his Earlier and Later Works.</b>&mdash;"As
he seldom dated his pictures, and early attained his full
development, we find a difficulty in determining the order in
which they were painted. His earlier works, however, may be
identified by the extraordinary minuteness with which all objects&mdash;trees,
plants, and every diversity in the soil&mdash;are represented;
by a decision of form bordering on hardness, and by
less freedom of handling and delicacy of a&euml;rial perspective."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></div>

<p><b>Reynolds's Estimate of him as a Landscape-Painter.</b>&mdash;Four
very fine examples of Jacob van <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins> are owned
by the Mauritshuis: a Cascade, a Strand, View of Haarlem,
and View of the Vijver at The Hague.</p>

<p>After a study of these beautiful works, Sir Joshua Reynolds's
estimate of the painter will not seem excessive:
"The landscapes of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>," he says, "have not only
great force, but have a freshness which is seen in scarce
any other painter."</p>

<p><b>His Character seen in his Paintings.</b>&mdash;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins> is considered
by many critics the greatest of the Dutch landscape-painters.
His execution is always masterly, and his works
always express a poetic sentiment. Ruisdael delights in
portraying sombre forests, rushing cascades, trees bent by
the wind, gathering storm-clouds, and all the dark mysteries
of the woodlands. His misfortunes probably had much to
do with increasing his natural melancholy, to the great gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of his artistic development. As a rule, the paintings of his
mature period have greatly blackened because he loved to
paint sombre backgrounds, and always used a very dark
green for his foliage and other verdure. His earlier works
have remained brighter in tint; for at the beginning of his
career he painted the dunes and meadows, woods and
roads near Haarlem, bathed in light from sunny skies half
veiled with clouds.</p>

Distant View of Haarlem</span>
</div>

<p><b>His Picture of Haarlem.</b>&mdash;The View of Haarlem, taken
from the dunes of Overveen, shows a bird's-eye view of
an immense stretch of country. In the foreground is
shown a level meadow on which strips of white linen are
being bleached; and on the left are the houses of the
washerwomen. Beyond, a vast stretch of country almost
destitute of trees or dwellings, reaches to the horizon line,
where the town of Haarlem, with its bell-tower, is discerned.</p>

<p>"All these miles of country," exclaims Burger, "are
represented on a little canvas only one foot eight inches
high!"</p>

<p>This picture is regarded as one of the gems of The
Hague Gallery.</p>

<p>The Cascade is noted for its warm lighting and careful
execution; and the beautiful Beach at Scheveningen for
its heavy gathering clouds and dim and broken light upon
the water and shipping.</p>

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>'s Sea Pieces.</b>&mdash;Ruisdael's sea-pieces are few;
and, unlike Willem <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>, he never represents the
ocean in repose; his sea is always stormy and sometimes
raging, and the sky is full of heavy, angry clouds. The
waves are always fluid and full of motion.</p>

<p><b>Some of his Notable Works.</b>&mdash;The Mauritshuis has
the rare luck to possess three pictures by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>, which
are splendidly preserved, and each of which exemplifies a
separate style of the master. A fourth one, bought more
recently, is also exceedingly interesting in its way, because
it gives a view of the Vijverberg in The Hague; but the rest
of this picture is of such dubious art, and the color so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sunken, that it cannot hold its own beside the others in the
collection. The Strand and the View of Haarlem belong
to the artist's middle period (between 1660 and 1670) as
well as the Cascade. Bredius says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The still, heavy impasto and the clearness of the color
make me think it is one of the first waterfalls that <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>
painted. We never, or hardly ever, find pictures of the painter's
earliest period (covering the years 1646 to 1655) in the Dutch
galleries.</p>

<p>"A fine, strong, cleverly painted little picture of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>'s,
painted in 1653, was sent to the Amsterdam Gallery with the
Dupper Collection. Another very clear, lovely, and beautifully
worked study of the Dunes, with a Grove, similar to the picture
in the Louvre, is owned by Madame van Vollenhoven in Amsterdam.
A somewhat dark but strong and spirited study, the
Hut in the Dunes, also of his early period, was lately acquired
by the Haarlem Gallery, which hitherto had owned nothing of
Ruisdael's. These early pictures, of which, for instance, the
Leipzig Exhibition in the Autumn of 1889 was able to show
very important examples (the figures are often supplied by
Berchem), are very highly esteemed by connoisseurs."</p>

<p><b>Love of Nature seen in his Earlier Works.</b>&mdash;"In these
works we see the youthful painter turning exclusively to Nature:
a clump of bushes on a dune; a glimpse of the 'Haarlemer
Hout'; a grove of trees on the shore, he paints exactly as he
saw them. But how he saw them! In these early pictures
his color is brighter, his manner of painting thicker and stronger
than in his later works. Instead of the beautiful clouds for
which <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins> was so famous, we often see the sky still
painted in a more antique manner, with striped clouds in the
style of his uncle Salomon.</p>

<p><b>His Growth toward Composition.</b>&mdash;"Gradually his subjects
become more 'composed,' but in the best sense of the
word. Only occasionally does he wander away, as, for instance,
in the Dresden Jewish Cemetery, which lay in the neighborhood
of Amsterdam, but which he set in a fanciful landscape unknown
to himself. He had quite another intention in the picture before
us: the View of Haarlem from Overveen, with its bleaching-green
in the foreground. Above it a beautifully clouded sky
with the floating clouds casting their shadows here and there
over the broad landscape. Amsterdam owns a similar picture;
the Berlin Gallery another; the Ritter de Steurs in Maestricht,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
a fourth; and there are still others in private collections in England
and Paris. Each of these pictures has a new excellence,&mdash;Nature
glorified through an artistic eye and immortalized
with the practised hand of an artist. What mastery there is in
the representation of the broad, broad space!"</p>

<p><b>His Carefulness of Detail.</b>&mdash;"Nevertheless <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins> does
not neglect the detail of his landscapes. We need only notice
in him the tree-characteristics&mdash;how carefully he handles every
kind of foliage in accordance with the forms of its leaves and
branches; but with him the whole is never subordinated to the
details. When he paints the sea&mdash;he does not paint it often&mdash;he
does it better and more artistically than any other painter.
What a mighty effect his great marine in Berlin produces!
The real air from the sea seems to blow upon us. Views of the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'sea-shore' and 'seashore' were used in this text. This was retained.">seashore</ins> by him are even rarer. The Hague picture shows us
a beautiful view of a sea and sky happily illuminated without
the dark, melancholy tone which so often dwells in his works,
and which we would consider as a reflection of his own sad
moods. Who can it be that painted the fine figures in this picture?
Perhaps it was Eglon van der Neer."</p></div>

<p><b>Vermeer's View of Delft.</b>&mdash;Vermeer of Delft (1632-75)
was a pupil of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Carel Fabritius' and 'Karel Fabricius' (or vice versa) were used in this text. This was retained.">Karel Fabricius</ins> (whom we shall meet in the
Rijks), who was a pupil of Rembrandt. One of the most
important and beautiful pictures in The Hague Gallery is
Vermeer's View of Delft. On an appreciative eye and receptive
mood it leaves a tenacious impression which will
never be forgotten. Until about thirty years ago, Vermeer
of Delft was hardly thought of, although in his own day his
pictures were highly prized and sought after, and later his
work received great praise from Sir Joshua Reynolds. It
was the French critic Burger (Thor&eacute;), who rehabilitated this
great artist.</p>

<p>Bredius exclaims:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"How this picture shines out from the others around it like a
stream of light out of dark clouds!</p>

<p>"All the light which the artist saw fall upon his town, he has
succeeded in concentrating at once in this picture, the broad,
masterful, sure painting, the luminous colors, the clear sky
which arches over the town, all excite our highest admiration."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>A drawing said to be a sketch for this picture is in the
Stadel Institute of Frankfort. The picture which brought
200 florins in 1698 was sold for 2,900 gulden at the Stinstra
sale in 1822. (See <a href="#Frontispiece">Frontispiece.</a>)</p>

<p><b>A Painter of Light and Sun.</b>&mdash;The beautiful picture of
Diana and her Nymphs, which was bought as a Maes in
Paris in 1876 for 4,725 gulden, is now attributed by some
people to this master, and by others to Vermeer of Utrecht.</p>

<p>Lemke says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Vermeer was a painter of the light and sun school; and
this was his chief study&mdash;to catch and hold fast the moment.
What Frans Hals did for physiognomy, grasping the flying
moment in an incomparable manner with winks, smiles, leers,
gesticulations, etc., and fixing it in paint, that Vermeer, as a
landscape-painter, delighted to do for the sunshine. He shows
its rays streaming into a room or the play of light and shadow
when the light with the moving air falls through heavy foliage
against a bright house and paints it with rays of light and shade.
Unlike the moment of Rembrandt and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>, which is fixed
for all eternity, with Vermeer the moment vibrates in the light.
The shadows lose their sharp outlines, and the fine brush-work
suggests the living change and play of the light. Rembrandt
paints light in darkness and lets it glow in the dark, or streaming
into it, or in a broad flood of brilliance; but Vermeer prefers
to set darkness or twilight against the light. For interiors, Vermeer
has another palette and mode of painting than for the outdoor
pictures. When he selects the moment for this, where the
scene consists of trees, houses, water, etc., it would seem that
the artist wanted to make us blink, as if we were looking at the
sun."</p></div>

<p><b>Vermeer's Portrait of a Girl.</b>&mdash;Vermeer did not confine
himself to landscape. In 1903, The Hague Gallery acquired
by bequest a remarkable portrait by this master, the
portrait of a girl wearing a buff coat, a blue and cream turban,
and magnificent pearl earrings, on which are "concentrated,"
says the enthusiastic Frank Rinder,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"those dreams of gray, which are Vermeer's. Although in this
portrait, with its liquid spots of light, we at once apprehend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the presence of Vermeer, with his nostalgia for the interpretation
of a beauty visioned inwardly rather than seen with the
eye, the picture passed through the auction rooms at The
Hague in 1878, fetching only 230 florins. It was bequeathed
in 1903 to the Mauritshuis by M. des Tombes."</p></div>

<p>"In his laying on of paint he was distinguished," says
Frank Rinder, "even among his technically well-equipped
contemporaries; by virtue of his isolated vision, he is
of all the Little Dutchmen the one inimitable weaver of
spells."</p>

<p><b>Jan Wijnants's Love for the Dunes.</b>&mdash;Jan Wijnants
(1615-80) has two pictures in the Mauritshuis, Clearing in
the Forest (1659) and Road through the Dunes (1675).
Wijnants, the Haarlemite, loved his dunes, and when he
lived for years in Amsterdam (probably he died there),
he painted them even more frequently,&mdash;every little hill,
with its sandy rises and with little stunted trees, and those
roads marked with deep wagon-ruts, almost always bright
and illumined with warm sunshine. How had he observed
them? How did he always know how to discover the paintable
spot? Frankly, his fancy sometimes made the hills
somewhat higher than we really find them at Haarlem;
indeed, sometimes, he created landscapes with so poetic a
flight, or we might say he sometimes composed them to
such an extent that in truth we might seek them in vain in
Holland; as, for instance, the great pictures in the Munich
museum. We are, therefore, forced to conclude that he
had seen Claude Lorraine's pictures, and wanted to paint
somewhat in the same spirit. In Haarlem he was painted
by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>, and as a fine little cavalier.</p>

<p><b>His Pictures enlivened by other Artists.</b>&mdash;When he
settled down in Amsterdam in 1660, the always ready
Adriaen <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins> often assisted him by enlivening his
landscapes with charming little figures. He had no idea
that at present a Wijnants would be so much more highly
valued on account of his little figures than it would be without
them. Lingelbach undertook this work later, straining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
after Van de Velde but not reaching him. In his early
pictures, Wijnants is somewhat labored; but by and by he
acquires that sureness of painting which must have become
ever easier to him because he almost always painted the
same subjects and the same style of landscape. In his last
pictures he was quite broad and decorative in style, but less
convincing. One picture with fine little figures by Lingelbach
bears the date 1675. In his Clearing in the Forest
(1659) he has depicted his favorite subjects: the old oaks
mutilated by the storm and partly stripped of their bark;
the fallen trunk of a tree and large, handsome plants, whose
leaves pour raindrops over the blades of grass that have
pushed their way up between them. Van de Velde has
added to this lovely landscape a distant farm, cattle walking
along the road, and a pond crossed by a rustic bridge.
"With such simple objects," exclaims Blanc, "Wijnants
and his pupil have produced a masterpiece, expressing a
poetry that few could perhaps explain, but which every well-organized
man can feel."</p>

<p><b>Neglect of Dutch Scenery by Dutch Artists.</b>&mdash;Wijnants,
like Van Goyen, is not only an excellent painter but chief
of a school. Until their time the artists of the Netherlands
hunted for scenery outside of their country; for instance,
Memling and Saftleven chose the borders of the Rhine;
others, like Savery, liked to wander in the Tyrol; others,
like Paul Bril, visited the Alps; others, like Everdingen,
went to Norway to get inspiration from pine forests and foaming
cascades; and Asselijn, Berghem, Jan Both, Moucheron,
and Pynacker sought the sunny clime of classic Italy. Into
the "Italian landscapes," which they either brought home
or finished from memory when they returned, they frequently
introduced among the classic ruins and sunlit verdure
the cattle and peasants of their own country.</p>

<p><b>Wijnants the Leader of a new School.</b>&mdash;Wijnants was
one of the first to take pleasure in his own country. In
the environs of Haarlem, his native town, he saw much that
would make pictures of charm; so, while other painters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
were roaming in foreign lands, he took walks in the neighboring
meadows and followed the paths that led to the
dunes, noticing everything on the way,&mdash;the tufts of grass,
the shrubs, the moss-covered stones, the trees, the roads,
the hillocks, the flowers, and taking note of the reflections
of light on the bark of the trees, the lichens growing on the
stump of a tree, the common bugloss, burdock, and thistle,
and the swarming insects. Wijnants was the first to show that
poetry was to be found in the lonely walk that led to the sea.</p>

<p><b>His Influence on other Artists.</b>&mdash;Nature seems to have
been his chief master; but he soon became the master of
others. Adriaen <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>, for instance, feeling his
vocation for landscape, entered his studio in Haarlem. It
is said that one day his wife said to him, "Wijnants, this
child is your pupil to-day, but one day he will be your
master." Instead of being jealous, the painter never ceased
to boast of his pupil's talent, and even allowed him to contribute
the figures in many of his landscapes,&mdash;for Wijnants
could paint only earth, trees, and sky. A great number of
the figures in Wijnants's pictures, therefore, are the work
of Adriaen van de Velde, who always introduces them
modestly and in such a way that they render the landscape
even more attractive. Philips <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins> and Lingelbach
also were employed by Wijnants to add figures to his pictures,
and a few times Adriaen van Ostade aided him, also

Jan Wouwermans, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Nicholas' and 'Nicholaes' de Helt were used in this text. This was retained.">Nicholas</ins> de Helt <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Stocade,' 'Stokade,' and 'Stockade' were used in this text. This was retained.">Stockade</ins>, the painter

animals.</p>

<p><b>Dutch Landscape-Painters who followed Wijnants.</b>&mdash;Wijnants
was, as has been said, one of the creators of the
Dutch landscape, one of the first to imitate Nature in her
humbler expression, finding beauty in common things.

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">Van de Velde</ins>'s Favorite Subjects.</b>&mdash;Adriaen
van de Velde (1635-72) was a painter of animals, figures, interiors
(rarely religious and historical subjects). He is
worthily represented in The Hague Gallery by two pictures:
a Dutch Roadstead and a Landscape with Cattle.
Van de Velde is also responsible for the figures in the pictures of
Van der Hagen (No. 47), <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van der Heyden,' 'Van der Heyde,' and 'Venderheydene' were used in this text. This was retained.">Van der Heyde</ins> (No. 53), and

is one of the few artists by whom landscape and figures composed
in a masterly manner are both felt and thought out
harmoniously. He stands so close to our modern impression
as does scarcely another of his day, being so simple in his
motives and going so straight to nature, that he knows how
to reveal the intimate connection between the outside world
and our own feeling. A real painter of moods, he excels in
awakening in us dark and gloomy feelings; his shadowy forest-glimpses
on summer days, with herdsmen reclining beside their
panting cattle in obvious rest. His bright mornings with the
hunting-parties called together to the halloo, with the gentlemen
and nobles promenading on the walks near their equipages, ring
fresh and gay in the heart of the spectator; in his homelike
evening-feeling with the sound of the returning cattle, he affects
us with the feeling of happy departure and well-earned rest."</p></div>

<p><b>His Helpfulness to other Artists.</b>&mdash;The strong feeling
in the figures, and, particularly, the lifelike color of the landscape,
is so individual that almost all the landscape-painters
of his home&mdash;Amsterdam&mdash;made use of his assistance in
peopling their landscapes,&mdash;Wijnants, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>, Hobbema,

both feeling and artistic effect is strengthened in the highest

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>His Skill as a Colorist.</b>&mdash;"The paintings of this artist have
an additional attraction in their rich and harmonious coloring,
the fineness of the tone, and the peculiar tender manipulation of
the pigments, which have such a soothing artistic effect.</p>

<p>"Some pictures painted in his last years have suffered by the
sinking in and change of color (notably the increase of blue in
the green leafage), by which some of their effect has been lost.
The Landscape with Cattle has not sunk in; but it has, nevertheless,
lost some of its original color in the green of the trees.
The idyllic landscape with its joyous, bright sunlight and its
peaceful animal life, is a good specimen of this style of

is more important. Two similar views of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'sea-shore' and 'seashore' were used in this text. This was retained.">seashore</ins> by

Willem.</p>

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>'s Delight in painting Horses.</b>&mdash;Philips
Wouwermans's (1619-68) half century of life was industriously
spent in producing about eight hundred pictures.
Although his preference for the representation of the horse
is evident in almost all his works, there is great variety in
the treatment. Wouwermans is at the same time a striking
landscape-painter. In many of his pictures the landscape
is astonishingly often foreign and sometimes even Italian
in subject, and the figures are merely lay-figures. The
Country Riding-School plainly exhibits the artist's delight
in horses. How beautifully painted are the grays on the
right! He draws a brown horse so often that it must have
been in particular favor. Some of his pictures must certainly
have cost the painter a great deal of time, especially
when numerous figures occur in them; as, for instance, in
his horse-fairs and battle pictures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Fruits of his Great Industry.</b>&mdash;It would appear that
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins> was well paid, for he was able to give his
daughter, who married the flower-painter, De Fromantiou,
a handsome dower,&mdash;Houbraken says 20,000 gulden! He
was buried with pomp in Haarlem, on May 23, 1668, having
bequeathed to his widow, who was destined not to
survive him two years, a very good estate; and to us such
a treasury of his art that we can enjoy it all over the world,
in almost every important public and private collection.</p>

<p><b>The Variety and Abundance of his Works.</b>&mdash;Whether
he shows us the horse wildly rearing in the battle or quietly
watering at the river, or being trained by an expert hand,
or returning home to a well-cared-for stall after a long ride,
we always admire again the rich variety of the master, who,
an eminent horseman of knowledge and enthusiasm, never
wearies us as such. Many of his pictures are a true reproduction
of the farm life, or of the warfare of his day; and, on
that account, have, moreover, a historical value. Dresden
alone possesses sixty-two, and St. Petersburg fifty, of his
pictures. The Hague Gallery has to be content with nine.
These are a Battle; the Hunt with Falcon; Arrival and
Departure from an Inn; A Country House; The Hay-Wagon;
the Hunters' Halt, a charming example of his
earliest period; A Landscape with Horses; and a Camp.
In all these the horse plays an important part.</p>

authentic works are distinguished by great spirit and animation,
and are infinitely varied and full of incident, though dealing
recurrently with cavalry battle pieces, military encampments,
scenes of cavalcades, and hunting and hawking parties. He is
equally excellent in his vivacious treatment of figures, in his
skilful animal painting, and in his admirable and appropriate
introduction of landscape backgrounds. Three different styles
have been observed as characteristic of the various periods of
his art. His earlier works are marked by the prevalence of a
foxy brown coloring, and by a tendency to an angular form in
the draughtsmanship; the productions of his middle period
have greater purity and brilliancy, and his latest and greatest
pictures possess more of force and breadth, and are full of a
delicate silvery gray tone."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></div>

his visit to the Royal Collection in 1781, Sir Joshua
Reynolds was greatly impressed with the pictures of this
artist, and said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Here are many of the best works of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins> whose
pictures are well worthy the attention and close examination
of a painter. One of the most remarkable of them is known by
the name of The Hay-Cart; another, in which there is a coach
and horses, is equally excellent. There are three pictures
hanging close together in his three different manners: his
middle manner is by much the best; the first and last have not
that liquid softness which characterizes his best works. Besides
his great skill in coloring, his horses are correctly drawn,
very spirited, of a beautiful form, and always in unison with their
ground. Upon the whole, he is one of the few painters whose
excellence in his way is such as leaves nothing to be wished
for."</p></div>

<p>Johannes Lingelbach (1623-74), a native of Frankfort-on-the-Main,
settled in Amsterdam on his return from Italy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>

coloring, as was almost always the case with Wijnants's,
and also with <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>'s in his latest manner, is characterized
by a cool and often delicate silvery tone, which with him
sometimes degenerates into coldness and want of harmony. In
his flesh, especially, a cold red tone often prevails, added to
which, neither in clearness nor impasto, does he equal the
above-named masters. He ranks, however, high for skill in
composition, good drawing, careful execution, to which is sometimes
added a happy vein of humor. He may be studied under
all his different aspects in the galleries of the Louvre, The
Hague, and Amsterdam. Of the four pictures by him in the
gallery of The Hague, the Italian Seaport, dated 1670, is
remarkable for a power and warmth quite unusual in this

<p><b>Examples showing the Variety of Lingelbach's Style.</b>&mdash;The
variety of his style is well exhibited in The Hague
Gallery by four pictures of different dates. These are the
Italian Seaport, with large figures, signed and dated 1670;
the Departure of Charles II. from Scheveningen for England
in 1660, a very rich, luminous, and fine work; a small
Cavalry March, in which the little figures are beautifully executed
and are thoroughly original; and a Landscape with a

Amstel at Amsterdam by Torenburg (1737-86), a few

by the landscape artists are all that the gallery owns.</p>

<p><b>Excellence of W. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>'s Marines.</b>&mdash;Willem
van de Velde (1633-1707) stands very high in the ranks
of the marine painters of the seventeenth century. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
last years of that century we have artists like Simon de
Vlieger, Jan van de Capelle, Hendrik Dubbels, and Abraham
van Beyerex (in his rare marines); but Van de Velde is a
master in his sphere, especially when he represents the calm
sea under bright sunlight.</p>

<p>In his View on the Y we obtain enjoyment from the fine
a&euml;rial perspective, the correct drawing of the ships, and the
numerous little figures. The accuracy of the detail does
not detract from the wonderful composition, the play of the
sunlight on sail and water, and the beautiful sky, lightly
flecked with clouds. Probably, the gaily decorated ship
on the left is the yacht of the Princes of Orange; the boat
which is being rowed away from it is bringing important
visitors to shore, while the trumpeter on the ship loudly
announces their departure.</p>

<p>Although not of the very first rank, this picture belongs
to the best work of the master's middle period.</p>

<p>The other picture, of exactly the same size, is also identical
in subject and treatment. Both are small. The other
picture owned in the Mauritshuis is the Capture of the Royal
Prince (June 18, 1666).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>His Greatness as a Marine Painter.</b>&mdash;"There is no question
that Willem <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins> the younger is the greatest marine
painter of the whole Dutch school. His untiring study
of nature of which his numerous sepia drawings are the best
evidence, his perfect knowledge of lineal and a&euml;rial perspective
and the incomparable technical process which he inherited
from his school,&mdash;all these qualifications enabled him to represent
the great element under every form, whether that of the
raging storm, the gentlest crisping wind, or of the profoundest
calm, with the utmost truth of form and color. Nor are his
skies, with their transparent ether and light and airy clouds, less
entitled to admiration than his seas; the surface of which he
diversified, with the purest feeling for the picturesque, by
various vessels, near and distant, which are drawn with a
knowledge that extends to every rope. Finally his various
lightnings create the most charming effect of light and shade.
With this combination of qualities, so calculated to please a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
seafaring nation, it is no wonder that he should have become
the most popular painter with the Dutch and English."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></div>

<p><b>The Fulness of his Knowledge of the Sea and Ships.</b>&mdash;Both
England and Holland, the two greatest sea nations,
agree that Willem <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins> was the greatest marine
painter up to his time. In fact, no one had so well observed
the motion of the waters, their breaking, or their
repose; and no one knew so well the habits of sailors, the
rigging of boats, their behavior and their variety. He
knew how to make them picturesque, whether isolated
between the sky and the water in the most beautiful lines,
or in cleverly foreshortening them while they gently rock
on the waves singly, or in picturesque groups. Nobody
has better understood the profound calm of the ocean,
or better expressed the emotion produced by an infinite
horizon.</p>

<p><b>The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">Van de Velde</ins> Family.</b>&mdash;The family was talented.
Willem the Elder, born at Leyden in 1611, was a magnificent
draughtsman, and taught his sons, Willem and
Adriaen, drawing. Willem, however, became a pupil of
Simon de Vlieger, and the pictures that he sent to his father,
then in the service of the English king, astonished the
Court. James II. sent for the young man and offered him
a pension. In England he frequently colored his father's
drawings; and on the Thames from Greenwich to London
he had a great opportunity for the study of shipping.</p>

<p><b>The Simplicity of W. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>'s Pictures.</b>&mdash;With
very simple details, Willem van de Velde produces marvellous
effects. He paints the ocean from the shore to the
distant horizon; and this straight line is in beautiful contrast
to the rounded clouds, while the severity of the tall
masts is relieved by the curves of the puffing sails. Sometimes
a group of fishermen on the beach or the end of a
wharf of piles is seen in the foreground; but he more frequently
begins his picture in the middle distance and gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the foreground up to waves slightly agitated or with a buoy
tossing in the rising tide, in such a way as to suggest that
the picture was painted not from the shore but from a
vessel at anchor.</p>

<p><b>W. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins> compared with other Painters.</b>&mdash;Sir
Joshua Reynolds said: "Another Raphael might be
born; but there could never be a second Willem van de Velde";
and Havard calls him "not only the greatest
marine painter of the Dutch school, but also one of the
greatest in the whole world." Blanc draws the following
distinction between Van de Velde and Backhuysen:
"Backhuysen makes us fear the sea, whilst Van de Velde
makes us love it."</p>

<p><b>Backhuysen, a Painter of Ships and Shipping.</b>&mdash;Backhuysen
(1631-1708) probably owed his darker moods to
his master <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Albert,' 'Aldert,' and 'Allart' van Everdingen were used in this text. This was retained.">Allart</ins> van Everdingen, who was a pupil of Pieter
Molijn (1600-54), whose works are now so rare, and
who was also one of the founders of Dutch landscape-painting.
Backhuysen was a painter of ships and shipping,
as well as of the sea, and had a practical knowledge of
nautical matters.</p>

<p><b>Examples showing his Style.</b>&mdash;Three pictures in The
Hague Gallery afford good examples for study of his style.
One, Entrance to a Dutch Port, dated 1693, shows an
agitated sea, very remarkable for the happy distribution
of sunlight and shadows of clouds upon the water, and
broad yet delicate treatment; another is a View of the
Wharf Belonging to the Dutch East India Company, and
is dated 1696; and the third has for its subject The Landing
of William III. of England in the Oranje Polder in
1692.</p>

<p><b>Imitators of Backhuysen.</b>&mdash;Pictures by Jan van de Capelle
and Jan Dubbels often pass for Backhuysen's; and
another imitator is Abraham Storck, who is greatly inferior
in elegance of touch. Good examples of Storck's style&mdash;a
Marine and a Shore&mdash;hang in The Hague Gallery.
Storck was much influenced by Lingelbach. The latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
was also quite successful with his harbors and quays, with
their shipping and human figures.</p>

<p><b>Simon de Vlieger as a Painter of the Ocean.</b>&mdash;A greater
painter, however, is Simon de Vlieger (1601-59), who is
supposed to have studied under Jan van Goyen, and painted
landscapes in the style of that master; he is famous for his
marines. He frequently painted sea pieces which included
the coast. He was the first to represent the ocean in its
varying moods. His execution is free and soft, and his
a&euml;rial perspective very fine. Like the majority of the
Dutch painters he loved to paint Scheveningen. His
Beach at Scheveningen, signed and dated 1643, is a fine
example of his work.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>The Diversity of his Subjects.</b>&mdash;"De Vlieger often paints
birds of the farmyard, which, both in truth and delicacy, are
equal to anything produced either by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins> or Flamen.
His horses, hares, and sheep may certainly pair with those of
Van der Hecke, Jouckeer, or Jean Leducq; his pigs are observed
differently from those of Karel Dujardin, but perhaps
they are more true to nature because he has not put any malice
or irony into his representation of them. The diversity of his
subjects, the talent he displays in grouping figures and animals
in an extensive landscape, or in a boat passing along a canal, or
on the beach of Scheveningen where, in The Hague picture, we
see them huddling together as if the ocean had just cast them
ashore with its shells and fishes; the art of lighting them so as
to delight the eyes without too greatly distracting the mind from
the spectacle of vast nature and the infinite ocean&mdash;all that
makes Simon de Vlieger one of the most remarkable Dutch
masters."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></div>

<p>De Vlieger was as eminent in interiors, ruins, and processions
as in marines and landscapes. He loved to frame
familiar and rustic scenes in beautiful landscapes; and he
had no need to call upon others, such as Barent Gael,
Schellinkx or <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">Van de Velde</ins>, for his figures, as so many
of his contemporaries did.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Painters of Architectural Pictures: De Vries.</b>&mdash;Pictures
in which architecture forms the chief interest had
their beginning with Jan Vriedeman de Vries, who devoted
himself to the study of Vitruvius and Serlio. His works
were very successful, though in the mannered taste of his
time.</p>

<p><b>Hendrik van Steenwyck and his Son.</b>&mdash;A scholar of
his, Hendrik van Steenwyck (1550-1604), who became a
master in Antwerp in 1577, painted chiefly interiors of
Gothic churches of fine perspective, both lineal and a&euml;rial,
and was the first to represent the light of torches and tapers
on architectural forms. One of the very numerous Francken
family usually added the human figures. His son Hendrik
van Steenwyck was his pupil and follower, though he painted
in a cooler tone and was inferior in all respects.</p>

<p><b>Pieter Neeffs and his Son.</b>&mdash;Pieter Neeffs (1620-75),
however, was the elder Steenwyck's best pupil. He followed
him in style but excelled him in warmth of tone,
power, and truthfulness in expressing torchlight effects.
Many of his pictures contain figures by Frans Francken
the younger, Jan Breughel, and David Teniers the elder.
In the Mauritshuis we find a good example of Pieter
Neeffs,&mdash;The Interior of a Church, with figures by Frans
Francken III.</p>

<p>His son of the same name was his pupil and follower,
but produced pictures of inferior merit. To this group belongs

painters." His subjects chiefly are well-known buildings,
palaces, churches, etc., in Holland and Belgium, canals
in Dutch towns with houses on their banks, fine perspective,
the views selected with great taste. The trees are rather
minute in foliage. The figures in many of his works

by Eglon van der Neer and Lingelbach. A View of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Church of the Jesuits at D&uuml;sseldorf, signed and dated
1667, is a valuable work. The figures are by A. van
de Velde. "The warm, clear chiaroscuro in which the
whole foreground is kept is admirable, while the sunlight
falling on the middle distance has a peculiar charm."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He
is also represented in The Hague Gallery by a still life.</p>

<p><b>Other Architectural Painters.</b>&mdash;Other architectural
painters are Gerrit Berckheyde, who painted exteriors of
buildings in his own country, and occasionally interiors
of churches; Jacob van der Ulft (1627-90), whose large
picture in the Mauritshuis of troops marching has already
been mentioned; Pieter Saenredam, whose works form a
transition from the earliest architectural painters like Pieter
Neeffs to the maturest expression of this class; Dirck van
Deelen, a pupil of Frans Hals, who has a view of the Binnenhof
with the last great Meeting of the States General;
Emanuel de Witte, who, strange to say, was a pupil of
Evert van Aelst, the painter of dead game and still life;
Hendrik van Vliet, pupil of his father, Willem, who has an
interior of part of the Old Church at Delft in the Mauritshuis,
of peculiar warmth, brilliancy of effect, and delicate
treatment of reflected lights; and last of all, Gerard Houckgeest
(?-1655), who is represented by the Interior of the
New Church at Delft and Tomb of William I. in the New
Church at Delft.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>The Excellence of Houckgeest's two Paintings.</b>&mdash;"This
almost unknown artist is a new proof of the astonishing efflorescence
of excellent painters in Holland about the middle of the
seventeenth century. Two views of the Interior of the New
Church at Delft, in The Hague Museum, are on a level with
the highest development of the school. It would be difficult to
render the brilliancy and transparency of full sunlight more
completely than in the one which contains the monuments of
the Princes of the House of Orange. The other picture also,
inscribed with the master's monogram, and 1631, is in every
respect, and especially in the soft and full treatment, of the
utmost excellence."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></div>

<p><b>Dou, Founder of the Leyden School.</b>&mdash;The founder of
the Leyden school of painters, Gerrit Dou (1613-75), is
represented in the Mauritshuis by a masterpiece of the first
rank, which is considered one of the gems of the gallery.
It is known as The Good Housekeeper, The Household,
and The Young Mother.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Good Housekeeper.</b>&mdash;In a large
room that serves as hall, dining-room, and sitting-room, as
well as kitchen, is seated a lady, handsomely dressed in a
morning costume. She has evidently just returned from
market; for there is a plucked fowl in a basket on the window
seat and an unplucked bird on the table, where a cabbage
also lies. A hare hangs on the wall above, and below
the table one notes a fish on a platter, and near a pot a
bunch of carrots. A lantern has fallen on the floor in the
foreground. The lady is sewing, with a basket beside her
and a sewing-pillow on her knee; while a little servant
watches the baby in its basket cradle. The pillar that supports
the roof is carved, the brass chandelier is of splendid
design, the draperies are heavy, and a coat-of-arms is
painted on the windows. Everything betokens wealth and
comfort.</p>

<p>The young mother looks at us in a very friendly way with
her attractive little face. Our attention is first attracted
to the group in the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'foregound'">foreground</ins>; but gradually we admire
the complete representation of all the little things around;
the wonderful, finely expressed chiaroscuro, the beautiful
stream of light, and the boldness of the shadowed yet
plainly visible group in the background. The picture belongs
to the artist's middle period and is dated 1658; and
although it has darkened, it is still full of rich color.</p>

 The Good Housekeeper" title="" />
<span class="caption">GERRIT DOU<br />
The Good Housekeeper</span>
</div>

<p><b>The Good Housekeeper presented to Charles II.</b>&mdash;When
Charles II. left Holland for his Restoration in
England, the directors of the East India Company could
think of no finer present to offer him than a picture by Gerrit
Dou, which they bought for 4,000 florins from M. de Bie.
It was this very picture of The Good Housekeeper, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
was afterwards brought back to Holland by William III. and
hung in his castle at Loo.</p>

<p><b>Dou's Style imitated by his Pupils.</b>&mdash;It is by such pictures
that we test the numerous works of his pupils, which
are now, and have been from the end of the seventeenth
century, offered for sale as Dou's. Very early in life Dou
made use of magnifying glasses, and with great care he
ground his own colors. Sandart relates that he once went
with Pieter de Laer to pay a visit to Dou, who was painting
a broomstick "which was slightly longer than a finger-nail."
When Sandart praised his great industry, he answered that
he "had to work about three days longer on it."</p>

<p><b>His Devotedness to his Work.</b>&mdash;When the weather was
not fine, he stopped his work. He devoted his whole life
to work. His palette, colors, and brushes he carefully protected
from dust, which gave him much trouble; he put
them away with the utmost care, and when he sat down to
paint he would wait a long time until the dust had entirely
settled. His studio was a large one with high lights, facing
the north and looking out on the still waters of the canal.</p>

<p><b>His Fondness for Domestic Subjects.</b>&mdash;He almost always
depicts a view of the interior of a burgher's dwelling.
He is the painter of nice, quiet domesticity, and his people
almost invariably look gay and happy. When he attempts
to portray strong emotions, his people do not look as if they
felt them; even his Dropsical Woman in the Louvre is dying
peacefully and with resignation. Dou was an excellent observer
of all surroundings, and the slightest objects in his
pictures are represented with the utmost completeness.
Dou could readily please, and form a school, in a Northern
and Protestant country, where people lead an indoor life, a
silent, concentrated family life, where man is attached to his
dwelling, adorns it with care, and closes it in, with the feeling
of a sanctuary. In fact, Dou painted only familiar subjects
on canvases or panels of small size, such as are suited to the
small cabinet of a <i>curieux</i>, and he was one of the first to set
in honor the most <i>recherch&eacute;</i> style of painting in Holland,&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of little pictures executed in that precious manner which
the French of the eighteenth century called the <i>beau fini</i>.</p>

<p><b>Dou and Rembrandt contrasted.</b>&mdash;Dou differed greatly
from his master, Rembrandt. The one had the fire of
genius; the other had patience. Even when Rembrandt
highly finished his pictures, he knew when to neglect some
accessory, to sacrifice some detail to the expression of the
essential parts, and thus to give full value to everything in
the picture that could appeal to the heart or interest the
mind. Dou, on the contrary, applying himself to what he
considered the last word of painting, tried to give equal
importance to everything that entered into his composition,
without admitting any of those negligences that are often
such happy artifices, and taking as much care in the finish
of a pewter pot as in expressing the feeling in a woman's
features, or the thought in a man's physiognomy. Therefore,
Dou's natural tendency, instead of being modified by Rembrandt,
became only more pronounced. As his master
broadened, his manner grew more smooth and polished.</p>

<p><b>The Fruit of Dou's Precautions.</b>&mdash;His care in making
his own brushes, colors, and varnishes, and his precautions
to keep his wet canvases free from dust (he chose a studio
overlooking stagnant water) have been rewarded by the
present condition of admirable preservation of his pictures.
His minuteness wearied his sitters and he soon failed as a
portrait-painter. It is related that he made a distinguished
Dutch lady, Madame Spiering, pose five days for her hand
alone.</p>

<p><b>He forsakes Portraits for Scenes in Common Life.</b>&mdash;As
his sitters left him one after another, Dou devoted himself
entirely to represent the scenes of common life without
giving himself any trouble in selection, being sure that in
them he would find opportunities to display his veritable
genius, that of detail. He was content to take what first
offered as a subject, and the circle of his invention did not
go beyond that. He simply observed life in the neighboring
shops: the pepper-seller, when she is dangling the scales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
with the tips of her fingers; the marketwoman verifying the
transparence of her eggs by the light of a candle, and the
mysterious interior of the barber-surgeon. If he sees in
the street a servant coming home from market loaded with
vegetables, counting what she has spent and what she is
going to steal from the change, there is a picture already
made. In the public square he stops to study the faces of
the simple dupes gathered around a charlatan vaunting his
elixir, teaching the practice of love-philtres, and drawing
teeth painlessly. His artist's eye finds motives readily at
hand; sometimes in the room of the embroiderer, absorbed
in her needlework; sometimes in the juvenile schoolroom,
where the martinet overawes his frolicsome pupils. He also
delights in representing the joys of the domestic hearth, that
ever simple and ever charming picture of the <i>mater familias</i>
busy with household cares, while the children are rolling
about on the floor at their grandmother's feet. Finally, he
sometimes goes so far as to be malicious and to complicate
the picturesque accidents of a winding staircase which a
woman descends softly to surprise her husband in the kitchen
with the servant.</p>

<p>The simplicity of trivialities Dou made the subject of
the finest and most precious pictures in the world. The
Herring Seller is as finely and minutely painted as The Philosopher
in Meditation.</p>

<p><b>He preferred Interiors to Open-Air Scenes.</b>&mdash;Dou seldom
painted open-air pictures. Interior light suited him
better; and moreover he had learned chiaroscuro from
Rembrandt. However, one of his most famous pictures,
The Charlatan (in the Old Pinakothek, Munich), is an exception.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Upon the whole, the single figure of the Woman Holding a
Hare, in Mr. Hope's collection, is worth more than this large
picture, in which perhaps there is ten times the quantity of
work."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p><b>His Foreground in Many Cases bordered by a Window.</b>&mdash;His
small pictures of one or two figures were usually framed
by a window. He has often painted his own portrait thus,
sometimes holding a trumpet, and sometimes playing a violin.
Having once found this natural border, the painter framed
all his models with it. To-day we see the girl with beautiful
blond hair blowing soap bubbles and smilingly watching
the prismatic globes rise in the air; to-morrow, the pretty
girl who is not sorry to have on her window-sill more than
one pretext for showing herself,&mdash;the canary-cage, hanging
outside; a letter to read; a pot of geraniums to water, and
what not. And this fresh face, which has for a background
the transparent shadow of a room wherein a group of people
are conversing, comes forward to be gracefully framed by
the vine that runs along the sash, and with its contours
relieves the cold regularity of the architecture.</p>

<p>It is certain that this patient imitator of nature must have
been very industrious, if we may judge from the number of
his pictures and the time he devoted to each. His pupil,
Karel de Moor, says so. The pronounced liking of his
countrymen for his pictures left him no repose.</p>

<p><b>The Best Example of his Candle-light Scenes.</b>&mdash;He
frequently painted by the aid of a concave mirror, and to
obtain exactness, looked at his subject through a frame
crossed with squares of silk thread. The Evening School,
in the Amsterdam Gallery, is the best example of the
candle-light scenes in which he excelled. President van
Spiering of The Hague paid him 1,000 florins a year simply
for the right of pre&euml;mption.</p>

<p><b>Godfried Schalcken, Pupil and Imitator of Dou.</b>&mdash;The
other picture credited to Dou, A Young Woman Holding a
Lamp in her Hand, and which was so greatly admired by
Sir Joshua Reynolds, is thought to be by Godfried Schalcken
(1643-1706). Those who are curious on this question
may turn to a picture by Schalcken called a Lady at
her Toilette, by candle-light, an effect which he was so
fond of painting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p><b>His Device for securing Candle-light Effects.</b>&mdash;Schalcken
was a pupil of Dou, under whom he acquired delicacy
of finish and skill in the treatment of light and shade. He
gained a reputation for his small domestic scenes, chiefly
with candle-light effects; and, to treat these accurately, he
is said to have placed the object he intended to paint in a
dark room with a lighted candle and peeping through a
small hole painted by daylight the effects he saw. A pupil
of Samuel van <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Hoogstraten,' 'Hoogstraaten,' and 'Hooghstraten' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hoogstraaten</ins> and Gerrit Dou (who were
pupils of Rembrandt), he became an imitator of the latter,
following him in his depth of tone, extreme finish, and preference
for night scenes.</p>

<p><b>Schalcken's Weakness in Drawing.</b>&mdash;Blanc says he
was aware of his weakness in drawing, particularly the
extremities of the human body, and this was one reason
he liked partly to conceal his subjects in shadows and
half-lights. His master, Dou, had made a sensation with
his Evening School (in the Rijks) in which the effect of
candle-light is treated with such skill; but what was a caprice
with Dou, Schalcken made a habit. His pictures are
a series of fantastic scenes and illusions. This painter saw
the night only; his pictures whether mythological, historical,
religious, or commonplace scenes, are always nocturnal
ones. Blanc says: "His brush was a permanent candle."</p>

<p><b>His Great Popularity.</b>&mdash;Schalcken, however, attained an
enormous vogue, and many of the wealthy Dutch had their
portraits painted by him, pleased with the mysterious or
piquant light he threw upon them. He went to London,
where he painted William III. with a candle in his hand.
This is now in the Rijks. Schalcken found Kneller too
strong a rival, and returned to Holland, having, however,
acquired a good deal of money. The Mauritshuis also
contains four others of his pictures: a Portrait of William
III., King of England; <i>La morale inutile</i>; A Visit to the
Doctor; and a Venus.</p>

<p><b>The Best Examples of Ostade's Work.</b>&mdash;Among the
best recognized examples of Ostade's work are: The Fiddler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and his Audience (1673) and Peasants in an Inn (1662),
in The Hague; The Village School (1662), in the Louvre;
the Tavern Courtyard (1670), at Cassel; and The Sportsman's
Rest (1671), at Amsterdam.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Fiddler.</b>&mdash;One of the gems of
The Hague Gallery is The Fiddler by Adriaen van Ostade
(1610-85). The old dilapidated inn with its broken
casement window is picturesque because of the graceful
festoons of vine-leaves that grow above the roof and penthouse.
A wandering fiddler is playing to the innkeeper
and his wife, who lean over the door, while five children
and a dog are variously grouped. A young man with a
large tankard in his hand also enjoys the music in his lazy
position.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Description of Peasants in an Inn.</b>&mdash;"Peasants in an
Inn was painted in 1662; but it exhibits all the qualities of
Ostade's best work. The figures are drawn true to life. Very
charming is the poodle gazing with great interest at the child,
who is eating his bread and butter. By allowing the full daylight
to fall from the left through the door while the background
is lighted by a high window, Ostade gives himself every opportunity
to express his chiaroscuro as beautifully as he desires.
The little pot on the tree-trunk and all the other still life of this
picture forcibly remind us that Ostade was an unusually great
master in this field. His small pictures of still life, principally
representing pots and other kitchen stuff, are pearls of the first
water; but they are somewhat rare. The coloring of this picture
is warm, but it melts into cool tones, which we find still
more strongly in The Organ Grinder of the same gallery, which
was painted eleven years later."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></div>

<p>The Demand in Marriage, painted between 1650 and
1655, also hangs in the Mauritshuis. This picture is owned
by Dr. A. Bredius.</p>

<p><b>Ostade's Pictures Generally taken from Low Life.</b>&mdash;The
number of Ostade's pictures as given by Smith is 385;
but it is thought that he painted even more. About 220
pictures have been traced in public and private collections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Adriaen Ostade was the contemporary of David Teniers
and Adriaen Brouwer, and, like them, chiefly devoted himself
to painting rustic and village life, tavern and gambling
scenes, brawls and open-air games. Smokers, drinkers,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'fish-wives' and 'fishwives' were used in this text. This was retained.">fish-wives</ins>, quacks, strolling musicians, itinerant players,
wood-cutters, children at play, alehouse-keepers and their
wives, all find sympathetic treatment. Like Brouwer,
Ostade wandered about the towns and country, finding his
models in the taverns and cottages.</p>

<p><b>Increase in the Value of his Pictures.</b>&mdash;He painted
with equal vigor at all times; and so highly appreciated is
he that pictures worth little in his day now bring large sums.
For instance, in 1876 Earl Dudley paid &pound;4,120 for a cottage
interior. According to Houbraken, Ostade was a pupil
of Frans Hals, while he was also teaching Brouwer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Crowe's Opinion of Ostade's Style.</b>&mdash;"There is less of
the style of Hals in Adriaen Ostade than in Brouwer, but a great
likeness to Brouwer in Ostade's early works. During the first
years of his career, Ostade displayed the same tendency to exaggeration
and frolic as his comrade. He had humor and
boisterous spirits, but he is to be distinguished from his rival
by a more general use of the principles of light and shade, and
especially by a greater concentration of light on a small surface
in contrast with a broad expanse of gloom. The key of his
harmonies remains for a time in the scale of grays. But his
treatment is dry and careful, and in this style he shuns no difficulties
of detail, representing cottages inside and out, with the
vine leaves covering the poorness of the outer side, and nothing
inside to deck the patch-work of rafters and thatch, or tumble-down
chimneys and ladder staircases, that make up the sordid
interior of the Dutch rustic of those days. His men and
women, attuned to these needy surroundings, are invariably
dressed in the poorest clothes. The hard life and privations of
the race are impressed on their shapes and faces, their shoes
and hats, worn at heel and battered to softness, as if they had
descended from generation to generation, so that the boy of ten
seems to wear the cast-off things of his sire and grandsire. It
was not easy to get poetry out of such materials. But the
greatness of Ostade lies in the fact that he often caught the
poetic side of the life of the peasant class, in spite of its ugliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and stunted form and misshapen features. He did so by giving
their vulgar sports, their quarrels, even their quieter moods of
enjoyment, the magic light of the sungleam, and by clothing the
wreck of cottages with gay vegetation."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></div>

<p><b>Ostade the Greatest Dutch Painter of Peasant Life in
his Day.</b>&mdash;Adriaen van Ostade is rightly regarded as the
greatest of the Dutch painters of the seventeenth century
who represented the peasant life of that day. In song and
dance, weddings and <i>kermesses</i>, at bowling, love-making, and
drinking, Ostade always was an observer of country folk,
although he himself was a townsman, and held a rather
exalted position in the world. His second wife seems to have
raised him into a very high social class of Amsterdam families,
as numerous records of executions of wills, which the
painter must have signed in Amsterdam, inform us. To
some extent, his peasants involuntarily progress parallel
with the force of his own life. In his earliest pictures,
when Ostade was still a modest artist, his peasants are also
still quite peasant-like; in his tavern-scenes things are still
very lively. Later, when the painter became closely related
to refined and well-to-do patricians, his peasants also became
more prosperous and polite; in a word, more decorous.
Unfortunately, his painting also became somewhat
more polished and smooth, so that the early pictures, and
particularly those of the middle period, more strongly delight
the heart of an artist than the cool, smooth works of
the later period. Ostade is eminent in his coloring, chiaroscuro,
and composition: he knows how to arrange his groups
in the most spontaneous and natural manner; and truly
artistic is his method of illumination, for which, knowingly
or unknowingly, he has to thank Rembrandt. In his earliest
pictures, which have a somewhat cold tone grading into
gray, reminding us of his teacher Hals (from 1631 to 1640),
there still remains some local color. The subjects, mostly
peasants in poor homes or in the tavern, are energetically
conceived. Bode rightly says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Instead of the pleasant humor and the poetry of the prosperous
middle class which are common to the later pictures,
these earlier works display an effort for characterizing according
to life and movement; a keen humor in the spirit of Hals and
Brouwer; and, particularly, a characteristic inquiry into the
separate individualities, such as the lifelike representation of an
expressive scene, the feasting, round dances, and fighting of his
jovial peasant folk."</p>

<p><b>Bredius on the increasing Brightness of his Pictures.</b>&mdash;"He
died in 1685. Before 1640 his chiaroscuro was already
finer, and between 1640 and 1655 (his flowering-time) many of
his pictures show no traces of Rembrandt's influence. The tone
of his works was quite different and approaches a warm brown;
the chiaroscuro, as, for instance, in his well-known Painter's
Studio in Amsterdam; and later, very closely repeated (Dresden,
1663), attains the highest degree of freedom; then his pictures
become somewhat slowly cooler, the tone gets constantly
grayer, but the drawing always remains strikingly correct, the
grouping natural, and the pictures become brighter, smoother,
and more polished. In the meantime Ostade had become a
finer, more respectable gentleman. Well on in years, he could
leave this life without worry, and was buried at Haarlem by his
admirers and pupils on May 2, 1685."</p></div>

<p><b>Ter Borch's Freedom from Grossness.</b>&mdash;Ter Borch
(1617-81) is excellent as a portrait-painter, but still
greater as a painter of <i>genre</i> subjects. He depicts with
admirable truth the life of the wealthy and cultured classes
of his time, and his work is free from any touch of the
grossness which finds so large a place in Dutch art. His
figures are well drawn and expressive in attitude; his
coloring is clear and rich, but his best skill lies in his
unequalled rendering of textiles in draperies.</p>

<p><b>The Elegance of his Sitters.</b>&mdash;Ter Borch was not only
an excellent painter of Conversations, he was, indeed, the
creator of his <i>genre</i>. With a little less wit and a little less
taste, perhaps, than Metsu, he charms you with his family
concerts, his <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> lovers, his light afternoon repasts,
and in selecting for heroes the most elegant cavaliers of the
world in which he lived. His pretty pages with great puffed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
sleeves striped with velvet, and those blond ladies with
transparent complexions, plump hands, and round waists,
constitute a type that no artist has so well represented as
Ter Borch. Before depicting these delightful and familiar
scenes, he first learned to imitate all that could add to the
charm of these pictures of private life,&mdash;silken draperies,
Turkish rugs, leather, ermine, velvet, and satin,&mdash;more particularly
satin, and <i>white</i> satin above all else. The most
striking example we shall see at the Rijks, in the picture
called Paternal Advice, known also as the <i>Robe de Satin</i>.</p>

<p><b>Resemblance between his Paintings and those of Metsu.</b>&mdash;There
is so much resemblance between Gerard Ter Borch
(or Terburg) and Metsu that at first it is hard to distinguish
them. Their subjects are much the same; for instead of
painting scenes of low life&mdash;inns with carousing peasants,
etc.&mdash;both turn with sympathy to high life; <i>sujets de mode</i>
is the name given to their works in which satins, velvets,
silks, and lace, rich robes and mantles, elegant hangings,
and table-carpets figure so largely.</p>

<p><b>The Difference between Ter Borch and Metsu.</b>&mdash;The
difference between Ter Borch and Metsu is defined by
Blanc, who says it is the difference between <i>bonhomie</i> and
<i>finesse</i>; the one is naive and gracious, the other ingenious
and piquant. Both, however, are charming in the way they
introduce us into a house and show us some little comedy
that is being played by the unconscious lovers, family group,
or party of friends. Like Metsu, Ter Borch is particularly
fond of making music a motive of his pictures. A timid
love often expresses itself to the notes of a mandolin or lute;
sometimes we surprise a musical party singing and playing
instruments; a lady composing music or trying a new piece
for the first time, while her gallant and richly dressed lover
stands by her side. Sometimes we see a young lady quite
alone in jacket of puce-colored velvet plucking her lute,
which rests on her satin skirt. Sometimes again the conversation
takes place in front of a clavecin, where the lady's
hands are painted in correct position, though she pauses to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
hear what her lover has to say, while her spaniel sleeps on
the foot-warmer.</p>

<p><b>Ter Borch's Conversations characterized.</b>&mdash;"Pretty
little dramas," Blanc calls these Conversations of Ter Borch,
"dramas without action or noise, which excite the thought
only, and whose intrigue consists only in a clasp of the hand,
the lowering of an eyelid, or the exchange of a glance and
a smile." He also calls attention to the type of woman
represented by Ter Borch, Van Mieris, and Metsu, all of
whom have high foreheads on which a few little curls
wander, like those made fashionable at this period by
Ninon de Lenclos, and known as "<i>boucles &agrave; la Ninon</i>."</p>

<p><b>The Women of Ter Borch's Pictures.</b>&mdash;The women of
Ter Borch's pictures are like Rousseau's pen-portrait of
Madame de Warens, who</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"had an air caressing and tender, a very gentle glance, ash-colored
hair of uncommon beauty, which she arranged in a very
<i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i> style that produced a piquant effect. She was small and
a little thick in the waist; but it would be impossible to find a
more beautiful head or a lovelier bust, hands, and arms."</p></div>

<p>Dr. Bredius, who calls attention to Ter Borch's position
in the hall of fame as singular in the fact that he has never
been assailed by critics, nor, on the other hand, sufficiently
appreciated, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Without striking originality, without any commanding dramatic
quality, without humor, and without any startling light effects,
Ter Borch is yet entitled to the name of the first <i>genre</i>
painter of Holland,&mdash;indeed, of all schools,&mdash;merely by his
perfect talent and fulfilment as an artist. Rightly is Ter Borch
called the most eminent painter of the Dutch school. Not only
does he paint high society almost exclusively, but he does it in a
distinguished style. The pose of his figures, the composition of
his picture, the fine color, the admirable drawing, all breathe an
elegance which is not met with elsewhere in the Dutch school.
Thereby, he is the one and only master of his subject. What
he paints is always completed to the highest degree. We never
find in him a trace of effort. What he does must be so and not
otherwise. We look for humor in him in vain; but nobility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
we always find, and not least in his likenesses, which, notwithstanding
their small dimensions, are 'the last word of a
portrait.'"</p></div>

The Despatch</span>
</div>

<p><b>Description of The Despatch.</b>&mdash;The Despatch, dated
1655, belongs to his second period. On a low chair beside
a table on which stand a decanter and beaker, an officer is
sitting with his wife or sweetheart. She is sitting on the floor
reclining against his knee. Both are young. He holds
the despatch in his hand and she looks somewhat distressed.
In front of them stands the trumpeter, who, it
appears, has brought the message. The officer is fully
dressed, and on the table beside him lie his weapons.</p>

<p><b>His own Likeness, painted by Himself.</b>&mdash;The other
picture of Ter Borch's in this gallery is his own likeness,
painted by himself about 1660. He is dressed entirely in
black and stands out strongly against a gray background.
He wears a large wig, the curls of which shade his rather
melancholy face, distinguished by a long nose and grayish
moustache. It was probably painted while Ter Borch was
a burgomaster of Deventer.</p>

<p><b>Caspar Netscher's Family Group.</b>&mdash;Much in the same
style as Ter Borch's Conversations is Netscher's Family
Group. Caspar Netscher (1639-84) was a pupil of Ter
Borch, and this is one of the best works of his best period.
The painter, in a red slashed jacket, is accompanying on his
lute his daughter, who is singing, and whose timidity is well
expressed. She wears a dress of white satin and has feathers
in her hair. On the other side of the table covered with a
Persian carpet, and in the half light, sits Netscher's wife.
On the back of the arm-chair in which Netscher is sitting
is his signature and the date 1665. Netscher is also represented
by two portraits&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Van Waalwijk.</p>

<p><b>Few Examples of Metsu.</b>&mdash;Metsu, like many other
Dutch masters, is poorly represented in the great public
galleries of his own country. While The Hague Gallery has
but three and the Rijks only four, the Louvre, for example,
has eight and Dresden six.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who have seen pictures by Metsu (1630-67),
Ter Borch, or Caspar Netscher, will have a better knowledge
of the customs and costumes of the upper classes at the
period of the Stadtholders, their faces, their polished manners,
their interiors, and even their thoughts, than if they
had read many books of travel, whole volumes of geography,
description, and history.</p>

<p><b>The Rich Dutchman as painted by Metsu.</b>&mdash;As he appears
in the pictures of Gabriel Metsu, the rich Dutchman
is domesticated, methodical, and well regulated in his life.
His house is the universe for him. In this cherished and
well-arranged abode, he concentrates as many joys as the
ancient kings of Asia assembled in the palaces of Susa or
Ecbatana. His country's and his own ships have "ploughed
the sea from end to end, penetrating to Japan for porcelain
and amber, and bringing back from Goa pepper and ginger."
From the ends of the earth have come to him all things
that could charm his family life and distract the melancholy
that the sad nature of the North and its long winters inspire.
Asia has sent to him her muslins, spices, and diamonds;
the polar ice has furnished him with the furs that edge the
velvet robes which his wife and his eldest daughter wear indoors.
The birds, insects, shells, and mineral specimens
of the most distant climes fill his cabinet, carefully arranged
under glass. In his gardens flourish rare plants, the choicest
flowers and bulbs cultivated by himself or under his own
eyes. His furniture, of exquisite taste and workmanship,
carefully looked after and incessantly cleaned, does not
suffer by the changes of fashion; it is transmitted from
father to son, and lasts for generations. His alcove bed is
supported by ebony columns and closed in with green damask
curtains. Hanging from the ceiling, a candelabrum
of gilt bronze spreads its branches twisted into elegant
volutes. The floors are waxed till they are a pleasure to
the eye, the windows are polished, the door-knob is shining,
the furniture gleams like a mirror, and yet the daylight
falling through lightly tinted taffeta curtains sheds over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
all these objects only a soft, moderate, and harmonious
radiance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>How Metsu depicts the Manners of the Dutch.</b>&mdash;"The
manners of Holland, as well as its material physiognomy in
civil life, its interiors, its furniture, the decoration and luxury of
its apartments, are all written down in Metsu's pictures with
charming clearness, which is all the more pleasing since this
merit seems to be involuntary in the painter. After two hundred
years, his work may serve for the complete reconstitution
of a well-to-do interior as it was composed in the seventeenth
century by the climate of the country, the character of its inhabitants,
and the historic circumstances in the midst of which
the Dutch merchants, the masters of the commerce of the world,
then lived.</p>

<p>"By Metsu's favor we are able to penetrate into those interiors
which are so jealously closed to strangers. Most often
it is by a window that serves as a frame for his picture that
Metsu gives us access to the boudoirs of fashionable ladies, and
makes us take them by surprise, sometimes in velvet <i>d&eacute;shabille</i>
writing their secrets; sometimes finishing their toilette in view
of a hoped-for visit; and sometimes breathing over the keys of
their clavecin the sighs of their hearts and the thoughts they do
not express."</p>

<p><b>His Carefulness in selecting Details.</b>&mdash;"Metsu rarely
paints an interior without introducing the pet spaniel of the
period, which often contributes much to our comprehension of
the scene by the character of its attitude.</p>

<p>"There are some Dutch masters who unintelligently accumulate
innumerable details everywhere. They make a picture of
manners the pretext for a ridiculous display of furniture, crystal,
lustres, <i>chinoisarie</i> and curiosities of every kind; their interiors
resemble bazaars. Metsu puts beside his subjects only those
details necessary to make the intrigue clear, and to explain the
conversation.</p>

<p><b>His Treatment of Still Life.</b>&mdash;"However great may
have been his talent for painting still life, he never allowed
himself to be carried away, like so many others, by that vulgar
pleasure; but, on the other hand, what finish! what a precious
touch! And then how he loves to give full value to the beauties
of local color, or to shade a Turkey carpet, or to grade down
the lights on gold and silver vases. What pleasure he takes in
the Bohemian glasses and the transparent liquors that half fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
them! The glasses in his pictures have great importance, for
the life of a retired Dutchman is spent in continual smoking
and drinking; but in Metsu we no longer see the Pantagruelesque
glasses of several stages that Van Ostade's peasants
always have in their hands; these are fine and more discrete
glasses, of elegant form, tall and oblong glasses in which the
Haarlem beer froths; glasses cut and fashioned in twenty different
ways, octagon glasses each facet of which ends with a
curve and which cut the light with their sharp edges, or glasses
the calyx of which forms a reversed cone on a heron's claw, or
elongates into a swan's neck, and finishes like a trumpet; lastly,
the glasses of the grandparents, sometimes of an imperishable
thickness and solidity, sometimes as delicate, light, and thin as
an onion skin."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></div>

<p><b>Favorite Subjects.</b>&mdash;Metsu is fond of representing
the patricians of his day and their womankind either in
pleasant entertainment, or, more frequently, in individual
figures engaged in quiet work. A picture of this class is
The Amateur Musicians. The lady on the left is very quietly
playing her instrument with the same sense of repose that is
expressed by the lady who seems to be writing down the
notes. Only on the face of the elegant gentleman standing
behind her chair is painted a merry, almost roguish, smile.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">

The Amateur Musicians" title="" />
<span class="caption">METSU<br />
The Amateur Musicians</span>
</div>

<p><b>The Elegance of Metsu's Figures.</b>&mdash;The figures are
drawn with certainty; the artistic handling of the subject
is remarkable; and a fine feeling for color is shown in the
selection of the tones. In Metsu's figures we notice an
elegance and a nobility which are not found elsewhere
except in Ter Borch.</p>

<p><b>The Influence of other Artists on Metsu.</b>&mdash;It is strange
that the earliest works of Metsu, which are the most broadly
painted ones, show little of Dou's influence, which is always
so unmistakable in his pupils, so that Bode believes he finds
in them the working of Hals's influence; and, in fact, the
large pictures of Metsu's early period are painted with a
broad brush in Hals's gray tones. When Metsu removed
to Amsterdam, he fell more under Rembrandt's influence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and the beautiful chiaroscuro of his later works incontestably
proves this.</p>

<p><b>His Miscellaneous Works.</b>&mdash;Metsu's Biblical and allegorial
pictures are the least important of his works. Besides
The Amateur Musicians, signed by Metsu, the Mauritshuis
possesses a fine Portrait of a Huntsman dated 1661, and a
great academical, constrained allegory of Justice Protecting
the Widow and Orphan, a picture that was found in the
vestibule of a house in Leyden in 1667. It was painted in
1655.</p>

<p>Crowe, who does not believe that this "rough and frosty
composition" is the work of Metsu, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What Metsu undertook and carried out from the first
with surprising success was the low life of the market and
tavern, contrasted with wonderful versatility by incidents of
high life and the drawing-room. In each of these spheres he
combined humor with expression, a keen appreciation of nature,
with feeling and breadth, with delicacy of touch, unsurpassed
by any of his contemporaries. In no single instance do the
artistic lessons of Rembrandt appear to have been lost on him.
The same principles of light and shade which had marked his
school work in The Woman Taken in Adultery<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> were applied to
subjects of quite a different kind. A group in a drawing-room,
a series of groups in the market-place, a single figure in the
gloom of a tavern or parlor, was treated with the utmost felicity
by fit concentration and gradation of light; a warm flush of
tone pervaded every part, and, with that, the study of texture in
stuffs was carried as far as it had been by Terburg, or Dou, if
not with the finish or the <i>brio</i> of De Hooch. Metsu's pictures
are all in such admirable keeping and so warm and harmonious
in his middle, or so cool and harmonious in his closing time,
that they always make a pleasing impression. They are more
subtle in modulation than Dou's, more spirited and forcible in
touch than Terburg's; and, if Terburg may of right claim to
have first painted the true satin robe, he never painted it more
softly or with more judgment as to color than Metsu."</p></div>

<p>One of the best pictures of Metsu's middle period is
The Market Place of Amsterdam, in the Louvre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Two Fine Portraits by F. van Mieris.</b>&mdash;Frans van Mieris
(1635-81) reached the highest rung of art in his portraits,
of which The Hague Gallery possesses two fine examples.
One is of Florentius Schuyl, Professor of Medicine
and Botany in the University of Leyden, painted in 1666,
and a still more important picture of the painter himself and
his wife. He has made a charming <i>genre</i> picture of it,
which Sir Joshua Reynolds admired, not knowing who the
characters were. The artist shows himself standing and
pulling the ear of the beautiful little dog which his wife holds
in her lap, while, to protect her pet, she gently wards off
her smiling husband with her right hand. The little dog's
mother is trying to spring into the lady's lap in order to
take care of her offspring. Both the drawing and modelling
here are masterly, and endow the scene with such
charm that this work must be pronounced one of the best
by his brush. The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'table-cloth' and 'tablecloth' were used in this text. This was retained.">tablecloth</ins> and the lute lying upon it
are beautifully painted.</p>

<p><b>Description of Soap Bubbles.</b>&mdash;Sir Joshua also noticed
the picture of Soap Bubbles dated 1663, representing
a boy at an open and vine-framed window, blowing bubbles
that are exquisitely painted and show beautiful reflections
and prismatic colors. His red hat with white plumes is
lying on the window-sill, near a bottle containing a sprig of
heliotrope, and above hangs a cage. Behind the child in
the half-light stands a young woman with a dog in her
arms. On the window-frame is written the date in
Roman numerals. Willem van Mieris often imitated this
composition of his father's, who frequently repeated it
himself.</p>

<p><b>Pictures by Van Mieris Full of Refinement.</b>&mdash;Van
Mieris takes us into an elegant world, although he himself
was fond of low life, a heavy drinker and the companion of
Jan Steen. He was the son of a goldsmith and diamond-setter
of Leyden, who wanted him to follow his business.
He was naturally influenced by his earliest surroundings,
and in his father's shop became familiar with the dress and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
manners of people of distinction. His eye was also fascinated
by the sheen of jewelry and stained glass. Houbraken
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Seeing his talent for painting his father placed him with
Abraham Torenvliet, a famous glass painter and a good draughtsman.
From him he passed to the school of Gerrit Dou, where
in a short time he eclipsed every one and gained the affection of
the master, who loved to call him 'the prince of his pupils.'
At the end of a few years, his father sent him to the historical
painter Abraham van Tempel; but he did not remain long with
him, for his natural taste would allow him to follow no other
manner than that of Gerrit Dou,&mdash;a manner extremely finished,
demanding attention and excessive care."</p></div>

<p><b>His Love of Elegant Accessories.</b>&mdash;Houbraken calls
Metsu a painter of <i>sujets de mode</i>. This term applies
also to Frans van Mieris; for certainly with him costumes,
materials, and accessories play an important part. If his
people were less attractive one might imagine that they
were only a pretext for showing off the velvet jackets, satin
skirts, and rich furs. Very often Van Mieris shows us a
spacious and magnificently decorated hall, in the background
of which a richly dressed lady and her lover are
walking; again he allows us to peep into a charmingly furnished
room where a lady in white satin is playing the lute
to entertain her guest, a handsome cavalier in black velvet;
or we surprise a lady as she is about to drink a glass of
wine which a page offers her on a silver salver. At other
times we find a group of ladies and gentlemen about to enjoy
a light repast; or see a table invitingly spread with
luscious fruit in rich silver dishes; or watch a lady feed
her parrot. Sometimes the pet monkey is discerned behind
the looped-back curtains of taffetas. Frans van Mieris
seldom chose panels above 12 by 15 inches in size. He
never ventured to design life-sized figures.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>The Kind of Subjects he treated Best.</b>&mdash;"Characteristic
of his art in its minute proportions is a shiny brightness and
metallic polish. The subjects which he treated best are those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in which he illustrated the habits or actions of the wealthier
classes; but he sometimes succeeded in homely incidents and
in portraits, and not unfrequently he ventured on allegory. He
repeatedly painted the satin skirt which Terburg brought into
fashion, and he often rivalled him in the faithful rendering of
rich and highly colored woven tissues. But he remained below
Terburg and Metsu, because he had not their delicate perception
of harmony, or their charming mellowness of touch and
tint; and he fell below Gerard Dou, because he was hard and
had not his feeling for effect by concentrated light and shade.
In the form of his composition, which sometimes represents the
framework of a window enlivened with greenery, and adorned
with bas-reliefs, within which figures are seen to the waist, his
model is certainly Gerard Dou."</p>

<p><b>His Lack of Humor.</b>&mdash;"It has been said that he possessed
some of the humor of Jan Steen, who was his friend, but the
only approach to humor in any of his works is the quaint attitude
and look of a tinker in a picture at Dresden, who glances
knowingly at a worn copper kettle which a maid asks him to
mend.... If there be a difference between his earlier and later
work, it is that the former was clearer and more delicate in
flesh, whilst the latter was often darker and more livid in the
shadows."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></div>

<p>Blanc says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among so many Dutch painters who copy nature it is
very pleasant to find one who deigns to select his models, and
who, preferring grace to ugliness, would rather paint beautifully
women elegantly dressed than <i>magots</i>. Strange, indeed! He
loved distinction, yet lived in a tavern; he loved luxury, and
was soon ruined; and, in spite of a life devoid of dignity, Van
Mieris always kept a love of beauty and elegance, as is shown
in his delicate faces, fine complexions, beautiful hands, grace
of attitude, taste in costume and furniture, and choice of splendid
materials."</p></div>

<p><b>Willem van Mieris.</b>&mdash;The Grocer's Shop, by his son and
pupil, Willem van Mieris (1662-1747), signed and dated
1717, also hangs in The Hague Gallery. In extreme finish
and minuteness of painting, this picture would not disgrace
Mieris the Elder or Gerrit Dou.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Its Wealth of Still Life.</b>&mdash;You see only two figures, a
young boy who is buying and a young woman who is selling;
but these figures are of no more importance than the
foods of all kinds exposed in the shop, on the sill of the
window, and outside. The lower part of the window is
decorated with a bas-relief, representing Cupids playing
with a bird. This bas-relief is half hidden by a superb
piece of tapestry, on which the painter has placed a basket
of dried fruits. Great bags of grain, peas, and beans, and
everything that is sold by the bushel are exposed on the
pavement of the street, with a bucket and some tubs filled
with olives, sardines, and anchovies. On the wall hang
a basket and a bird-cage, and a magnificent damask curtain
with large flowers falls in graceful folds from an outside
ring. Among the innumerable details of the shop
you note a little rat gnawing at the grains which have fallen
through a hole in one of the sacks.</p>

<p>The pendant to this picture hangs in the Louvre, where
it is called <i>Marchande de Volailles</i>.</p>

<p><b>W. van Mieris influenced by his Father and by G. de
Lairesse.</b>&mdash;Willem van Mieris was a pupil of his father,
and at first had no other ambition than to imitate his style
and produce those charming Conversations in which rich
furniture, shining chandeliers of brass or copper, Japanese
porcelains, silken curtains, Turkish table-carpets, flowers,
and elegantly dressed people make a somewhat restricted,
although delightful, world. Willem, falling under the influence
of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'G&eacute;rard' and 'Gerard' de Lairesse were used in this text. This was retained.">G&eacute;rard</ins> de Lairesse, who was much in vogue in
Holland, selected such subjects as a young lady playing on
the clavecin, or making lace, or walking in the country in a
lilac satin robe with large sleeves that reveal through their
slashes a beautiful arm, and a straw hat ornamented with a
sweeping plume. Becoming a shepherdess this attractive
lady next sits in his pictures with bare feet, in the shade of
an oak, and beside her Corydon talks of love.</p>

<p><b>His Success with Mythical and Biblical Subjects.</b>&mdash;Next
he turned his attention to subjects from fable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
romance, and mythology; and Diana, Armida, Cleopatra,
Bacchus, Jupiter, Tarquin, the Sabines, etc., fill his panels
or copper plates, which were hardly larger than your hand.
Biblical and religious subjects occupied him for a time and
then he again turned pagan. His success grew greater
every day, and his Dutch patrons who loved scenes of
familiar life demanded from Van Mieris pictures in the style
of his famous father&mdash;those charming <i>genre</i> pictures still
being produced by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Slingelandt' and 'Slingerlandt' were used in this text. This was retained.">Slingelandt</ins>, Van Tol, and other imitators
of Gerrit Dou.</p>

<p><b>A Window-frame his Favorite Setting.</b>&mdash;Like Gerrit
Dou, Willem van Mieris selects a window-frame of stone,
which he often decorates with graceful creepers or a bouquet
of tulips or jonquils placed on the sill, or throws over it
a bright piece of tapestry. From it a blond lady leans to
flirt with the unseen passer, a child blows bubbles, a portly
dame waters her flowers; or the artist himself sits calmly
by. When tired of this, Willem van Mieris takes us to his
favorite shop.</p>

<p><b>Arie de Vois.</b>&mdash;Among the portraits one must not fail
to notice the picture of A Huntsman Holding a Partridge
by Arie de Vois (1630-80). This was originally in the
collection of William V. and was bought for 1,210 florins.
His pictures are so rare that we are not surprised that the
Mauritshuis contains but one example. The Rijks is more
fortunate in owning four by this delightful painter.</p>

<p><b>Abraham de Pape's Style.</b>&mdash;Abraham de Pape (1625-66),
supposed to have been a pupil of Gerrit Dou, is
represented by An Old Woman Plucking a Cock, with a
little boy kneeling beside her. It is a very good example
of this master; and at the Gerrit Muller sale brought no
less than 490 florins. Crowe says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This almost unknown artist is decidedly one of the best
<i>genre</i> painters of this time. He is true and speaking in action,
animated in his heads, harmonious, and even in some of his
pictures warm in coloring, and very careful and soft in execution."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p><b>A. van der Werff's Biblical and Mythological Pictures.</b>&mdash;Adriaan
van der Werff (1659-1722) occupied a peculiar
position among Dutch painters. While his contemporaries
were devoting themselves to the study of nature and becoming
realistic, he adhered to the pursuit of the ideal and
produced pictures inspired by Biblical or mythological
subjects,&mdash;pictures noted for their beauty and elegance,
and moreover finished with wonderful smoothness of touch,
which he had learned from his master Eglon van der
Neer. His figures as a rule are small, and the flesh-tints
are of an ivory tone. Van der Werff was so popular
that it was impossible for him to execute all the commissions
sent him. His greatest patron was the Elector Palatine
John William; the pictures that Van der Werff painted
for him are now in Munich, where this master may best be
studied.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Flight into Egypt.</b>&mdash;He is fairly
well represented in the Rijks; but The Hague has only two
of his works,&mdash;a Portrait of a Man, dated 1689, and The
Flight into Egypt, dated 1710. This is only one foot six
inches high and one foot two inches wide. The Virgin is
in profile in a Prussian-blue mantle, accompanied by St.
Joseph, who is leading an ass. The road runs by the side
of a brook, and the landscape is diversified with trees,
ruins, and a portico. This picture was given by the artist
to his daughter, who sold it to Mr. Schuijlenberg for 4,000
florins. At the Schuijlenberg sale at The Hague in 1765
it brought 6,500 florins.</p>

<p><b>Reynolds on Van der Werff's Manner.</b>&mdash;This picture
was much admired by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who saw it in
the King's collection. In describing Van der Werff's
manner he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He has also the defect which is often found in Rembrandt,&mdash;that
of making his light only a single spot. However, to do
him justice his figures and heads are generally well drawn and
his drapery is excellent; perhaps there are in his pictures as
perfect examples of drapery as are to be found in any other
painter's work whatever."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Philip van Dijk and his pupil, Louis de Moni.</b>&mdash;To this
group belongs Philip van Dijk (1680-1753), a pupil of
Arnold Boonen, and an imitator of Van der Werff. Judith
with the Head of Holofernes is a good example of his
historical work; and two good <i>genre</i> pictures, A Lady
Playing the Guitar, and A Lady at her Toilet, show this
artist in a happier mood, where he gives free play to his
more delicate touch. His Bookkeeper also hangs in this
gallery. His pupil, Louis de Moni, shows the decline of the
school. An Old Woman and a Boy, in a window, the boy
blowing soap bubbles, is dated 1742.</p>

<p><b>Ochtervelt a follower of Metsu and of Pieter de Hooch.</b>&mdash;Jacob
van Ochtervelt (?-1700), who occupies a first
place among the second-rate painters of his day, was a
follower of Metsu and also of Pieter de Hooch. The Fish
Vender, representing a woman in a room where a man is
offering her fish, in conception and careful finish recalls
Metsu, while in lighting and combination of color it reminds
one of Pieter de Hooch. The general tone is
warmer than most of Ochtervelt's pictures.</p>

<p><b>Jan Steen's Favorite Subjects.</b>&mdash;One of the greatest of
all the Dutch <i>genre</i> painters is Jan Steen (1626-79), "the
jolly landlord of Leyden." As a draughtsman and colorist
he takes high rank, and as a student of human nature he
has been compared to Hogarth and Moli&egrave;re. His pictures
are studies of life and character, and are full of humor.
He paints feasts and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'merry-making' and 'merrymaking' were used in this text. This was retained.">merry-makings</ins>, weddings, quacks,
tavern-brawls, dentists, invalids, children at play, family
parties, etc., with sympathy and joyousness.</p>

<p><b>His Character-painting.</b>&mdash;As a character-painter, he is
unapproachable. Nobody so well as he has understood all
human passions, all emotions&mdash;hilarious joy, deep-seated
satisfaction, fear, grief, and <i>Weltschmerz</i> with such mastery,
and known how to represent them in the smallest possible
space.</p>

<p><b>His Method of showing Background to Advantage.</b>&mdash;With
regard to Jan Steen's interiors it is interesting to note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
that, like Ostade's, they are painted from an elevation, so
that the figures in the background are not hidden by those in
the foreground. Ordinarily he opens a window in the background
to illuminate the distant figures and thus is formed
an echo of the principal light. The number of utensils is
less than with most painters of this class, for Jan Steen had
too much sense to multiply them uselessly. Like Metsu,
he often painted little pictures on the walls of his interiors,
and it is singular that these depict heroic landscapes,
battle scenes, mythological subjects, etc., and never tavern
or <i>genre</i> scenes such as he himself painted.</p>

<p><b>Refinement and Culture in his Pictures.</b>&mdash;Another thing
to notice is that whether in houses of affluence or in common
taverns his people do not drink grossly and from jugs,
as in the taverns of Adriaen Brouwer. Each one takes his
place gracefully and naturally at the table or in the room;
and the details of the furniture accord with the politeness
of the people or the players. On the mantelpiece, for
instance, stands a bronze figure of Love; a guitar hangs
from one of the panels; and here hangs a fine landscape
in an ebony frame. The collation consists of delicious
fruits that rejoice the eyes; perhaps also open oysters, which
glisten in the light like pearls; ripe grapes and beautiful
peaches, whose furry skins are blushing like the cheeks of a
young girl, and finally some lemons half peeled, the skin
falling in a golden spiral. All this shows the influence of
Van Mieris, who was a friend of Steen and who spent
many hours in his tavern at Leyden.</p>

<p><b>Reynolds's Appreciation of Jan Steen.</b>&mdash;Sir Joshua
Reynolds, who was so delighted with the Steens he saw in
Holland, wrote the following appreciative criticism of the
artist:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Jan Steen has a strong manly style of painting, which might
become even the design of Raffaelle, and he has shown the
greatest skill in composition and management of light and
shadow as well as great truth in the expression and character
of his figures."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Jan Steen's Fondness for painting his own Family.</b>&mdash;Jan
Steen was very fond of painting his own family; his
wives, his aged parents, and his children provided him with
varied models of assorted ages and sizes. He had six
children by his wife <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Marguerite' and 'Margarita' van Goyen were used in this text. This was retained.">Marguerite</ins> van Goyen, daughter of the
painter; and when she died, he married a widow, named
Mariette Herkulens, who had two. He has characterized
the pleasures of all ages in his picture called The Family
of Jan Steen, bearing the legend "<i>Soo de ouden songen pypen
de jongen.</i>" (As the old ones sing so will the young ones
pipe.) This is particularly interesting, because the artist
has painted himself between his wife Marguerite van Goyen
and Mariette Herkulens, who was destined to be his second
wife. They were both quite handsome, especially Marguerite.
Mariette Herkulens was a meat vender.</p>

<p><b>How he ridiculed the Physicians.</b>&mdash;Physicians were
always butt for Steen's caustic wit. It was a common practice
in the seventeenth century to turn them into ridicule;
and as Moli&egrave;re brought them on the French stage, Jan
Steen painted them with all their charlatanism and gravity
and that severity of costume so studied for effect.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Young Lady who is Ill.</b>&mdash;The
Hague Gallery contains two of these,&mdash;one known as The
Young Lady who is Ill (sometimes called The Doctor
Feeling the Pulse of a Young Woman). In this picture a
doctor dressed in black, with a pointed hat like that worn
by Sagnarelle in the <i>M&eacute;decin malgr&eacute; lui</i>, is seated at the
bedside of a young and pretty girl with round arms and
clear, pale complexion, who looks with interest at the potion
that is being prepared according to the doctor's instructions.
The latter pretends to be looking at the medicine
which an elegant woman is bringing, but he is really looking
at the beautiful throat of the blond and well-dressed Dutch
lady, who lowers her eyes, charmed to let him gaze at her
brilliant white neck, her little <i>retrouss&eacute;</i> nose, and her hair
arranged <i>&agrave; la Ninon</i>, which is half covered with a sort of
black cap. "If it were not for a little touch of malice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
certain inconsistencies in the somewhat careless execution,"
Blanc says, "this picture might pass for a Van Mieris or a
Metsu."</p>

<p><b>Description of The Doctor's Visit.</b>&mdash;In The Doctor's
Visit, a physician dressed in black, with pointed hat and
holding his gloves in one hand, with the other is feeling the
pulse of a young lady who is sitting near her bed in a
<i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i> costume. With a very knowing and solicitous manner
the doctor seems to interrogate the throbs of the pulse;
but while he seeks for the secret of the illness, the chamber-maid
has found it out, as her glance indicates; and, that
you may not be left in doubt, the painter has placed on the
corner of the chimney a little statue of Love the Conqueror.
In some of his pictures of this class Steen adds the legend
"<i>Wat baet hier medecyn&mdash;het is der minne pijn</i>" (Of what
use is medicine here? Love is the trouble).</p>

<p><b>Other Pictures by Jan Steen, in the Mauritshuis.</b>&mdash;In
addition to those already mentioned, the Mauritshuis owns
A Village Feast, a picture of his first period; the Dentist,
who is extracting the tooth of a peasant; A Menagerie;
and an Interior known as The Oyster Feast and Jan
Steen's Tap-room.</p>

<p><b>Description of Jan Steen's Tap-room.</b>&mdash;The latter is
not an inn of the common or rustic type such as is seen in
Ostade's or Brouwer's pictures, for the room is furnished
in the best style of the period. In it we see about twenty
figures in several groups. On the left, an old man is playing
with a little child; near him a young girl is kneeling
as she cooks the oysters; and in the centre an old man
offers an oyster to a seated woman. Children are amusing
themselves everywhere: here one is making a cat dance;
another is holding a dog; another is carrying a jug and a
basket of fruit. At the table on the right and a little back
Jan Steen sits playing a lute, a young woman is listening to
him, a fat companion with a glass of liquor in his hand is
laughing; and in the background are groups of players and
smokers. Above and in the foreground a large violet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
curtain is looped and casts its shadow over a part of the
interior. This fine picture is only 2 feet 3 inches by 2 feet
8 inches.</p>

<p><b>Description of A Menagerie.</b>&mdash;A Menagerie is nearly
four feet square, and represents the courtyard of a country
house&mdash;that of William III. at Honsholredijk, which
is seen in the distance. Near the stone terrace, beneath
the steps of which is a pool, a peacock sits on a branch of
an old tree; ducks are swimming in the pool, and hens,
turkeys, and pigeons are picking up grains in the courtyard.
A little girl in a pale straw-colored dress and a white apron
is sitting on the steps and giving a lamb milk out of a cup.
A man, carrying a basket of eggs and a green pot, is laughing
and talking with her. Another old farm-servant is also
laughing as he regards his young mistress; another person,
who carries a hen under his left arm and her brood of
chickens in a basket, is one of those dumpy and deformed
creatures that Jan Steen likes to paint. Burger considers
the head of the man with the basket of eggs is one of
the most wonderful heads that were ever painted by Jan
Steen or any of the Dutch Little Masters.</p>

<p><b>Troost, the Dutch Watteau or Hogarth.</b>&mdash;Cornelis
Troost (1697-1750) was born at the close of the great
period of Dutch art. The great painters were all dead.
Dutch painting had lost its originality and native vigor.
Under these circumstances Troost made himself the painter
of his period and of his country. Impelled by a witty and
caustic humor, he thought to bring back in the eighteenth
century what Jan Steen had illustrated in the seventeenth.
But, inferior in every way to that master, he saw contemporary
society only on the stage or in books; and, instead
of painting manners, customs, and absurdities of the middle
classes by observing them in nature, he painted them as
they were represented on the stage. Almost all his heroes
were characters of the comedy or the novel. Troost has
been called the Dutch Watteau and the Dutch Hogarth.
His pictures may be classified as follows: Conversations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Comic subjects, Portraits, and Military subjects. The
first follow the style of Watteau; the second, Hogarth;
and the last are reminiscent of Frans Hals.</p>

<p><b>His Excellence in Drawing and Color.</b>&mdash;Excellence of
drawing and richness of color distinguish all his works, which
are also valuable for their accurate portrayal of the manners
and customs, costume and furniture of his day. Troost
worked in oil, pastel, and gouache with equal facility; and
produced many excellent mezzotints and etchings.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Blanc on Troost's Style.</b>&mdash;"What we admire in him to-day
is the talent of the painter properly so-called, the art of enlightening
and grouping his figures and placing them on the stage, the
brush-work, the selection and quality of the tones,&mdash;in other
words, order, chiaroscuro, color, and touch. A man of wit, he
shines in composition; although adroitly calculated, his own
humor always appears spontaneous and natural. Troost never
introduces useless personages nor superfluous ornaments into
his pictures. He clearly sets forth what he wants to show;
and, contrary to the habits of the other masters of his nation
who take pleasure in the accumulation of accessories, he only
puts into his interiors necessary furniture and significant
utensils; and in his open-air Conversations the surroundings are
not overloaded with detail, but simple and agreeable, being
calculated to achieve the idea of the picture, so admirably are
they connected with the action of the figures. Troost and
Terburg, of all the Dutch masters of <i>genre</i>, are the ones who
best understood the concentration of the interest of a picture,
and what is called the repose of the composition."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><b>A Picture Illustrative of the Concentration of its Interest.</b>&mdash;"On
looking over his pictures in the little room devoted to
his work in the Mauritshuis, we find more than one example of
this intelligent sobriety. Take for instance <i>L'Amour mal
assort&eacute;</i>. Here we have an old man declaring his love to a
young widow. He has thrown on the floor his cane, hat, and
gloves; and, in his senile ardor, he clasps the facilely chaste
Susanna. What a pretty interior! A <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Slingelandt' and 'Slingerlandt' were used in this text. This was retained.">Slingelandt</ins>, a Gerard
Dou, or a Mieris would have multiplied here the details of
domestic comfort; here there is not a detail, not a single piece
of furniture too much; but yet there is nothing lacking that
should be there,&mdash;neither the clock, the canary in its cage, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
portrait of the deceased husband whose place the guest desires
to fill, nor the flower-vase with its full-blown rose, like the
charmer whom the admirer wants to gather."</p>

<p><b>Pictures of Love and Intrigue.</b>&mdash;"Again we have The
Deceived Tutor, a scene anticipated from 'The Barber of
Seville.' Here we see coming down the street a maiden led
prisoner by her tutor, a jealous bear clothed all in black.
While she occupies his attention with a sweet smile, her little
hand receives the kiss of a lover whom chance has led that way.
Other scenes of similar intrigue treated in this light vein are
The Lover in Disguise and The Lover Artist. The scenes
are taken from the comedies and vaudevilles of Langendijk,
Lingelbach, Asselijn, Van der Hoeven, Van Paffenrode, and
D. Buysero."</p>

<p><b>The Dispute of the Astronomers.</b>&mdash;"A picture that does
not deal with love and intrigue, but is full of a different kind of
humor is The Dispute of the Astronomers, from a comedy by
P. Langendijk, in which two astronomers in the heat of their
discussion on the systems of Copernicus and Ptolemy make use
of the plates and bottles on the supper table to illustrate the
sun and the planets. Another interesting pastel is one depicting
the old Dutch custom of a band of men and children singing
hymns before the doors of the village on Twelfth Night,
carrying a huge paper star, lighted within."</p></div>

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins>, Painter of Living Birds.</b>&mdash;The great
Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636-95) began his career
with marines; but it was not long before he acquired
celebrity as a painter of birds only, which he represented
not exclusively like Fyt, after a day's shooting, or as stock
in a poulterer's shop, but as living beings with passions of
joy and fear and anger. Though without Fyt's brilliant
tone and high finish, his birds are always full of action.
William III. employed him to paint his menagerie at Loo,
and this picture shows that he could overcome the difficulty
of painting India's cattle, elephants, and gazelles.
Hondecoeter's best pictures have remained in Holland, and
The Hague and Amsterdam galleries possess his most interesting
canvases. The four at the Mauritshuis are: Geese
and Ducks, Hens and Ducks, The Menagerie of William
III. at Loo, and The Jackdaw Stripped of his Borrowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Feathers. All these are worthy of study, although Hondecoeter's
most celebrated picture, The Floating Feather,
hangs in the Rijks.</p>

<p>Blanc says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In one of these the artist has amused himself with making
his usual heroes play a scene of human comedy; and, as a professional
fabulist would have imagined it, he has shown a jackdaw
stripped of the borrowed plumes with which he had adorned
himself in his vanity. This is a very fine picture, although it
has somewhat blackened in certain parts. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins> seems
to us to have been happier in another canvas in which he has
grouped various birds. It seems as if on this occasion he
wanted to prove what prodigies he was capable of in the touch
of divers plumages; and the effect he has obtained is, in truth,
astonishing. We could not find the equivalent of this lightness
of touch and of this coloring either in Gryff<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> or in the two
Weenixes, or in any of the masters who have tried to paint
birds, with the possible exception of Giacomo Victor."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><b>His Preparation for Bird-painting.</b>&mdash;"It is true that
before having succeeded so well in the representation of the
bird, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins> made a long study, not only of its external
form, but of its habits, customs, and manner of life. His studio
had been turned into a menagerie, or, rather, a game preserve.
He had paid particular attention to the education of a handsome
cock, which seemed to comprehend every word and
gesture of his master; and who, at the slightest sign, came
near the easel and posed, often in very fatiguing attitudes, for
hours."</p>

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins>'s Skill in painting Farmyard Scenes.</b>&mdash;"In
painting, Melchior d'Hondecoeter was a very able man without
leaving the poultry yard, and was satisfied with painting on
the spot either the bloody dramas or the peaceful scenes of the
farmyard&mdash;the hen teaching her chickens to scratch for grubs,
the duck giving her little ones their first swimming lesson, the
superb cock keeping watch over his seraglio, the peacock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
spreading his magnificent tail, and those memorable combats
in which for a fine-plumaged Helen, two rivals spur one another
while awaiting the hawk's talons. He painted 'the crested
gentry' and knew how to interest us in them by means of
picturesque truth, rustic grace, color, and spirit.</p>

<p>"Melchior, after the death of his father, found an excellent
guide in his uncle, J. B. Weenix, and followed his manner till
his death in 1660 without servility."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></div>

<p>Burger says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>His Pictures of Bird Families.</b>&mdash;"No one has painted
better than he cocks and hens, ducks and drakes, and particularly
little chicks and ducklings. He has understood such
families as the Italians have the mystical Holy Family; he has
expressed the motherhood of the hen as Raphael has the
motherhood of the Madonna. In fact, the subject is more
naturally treated because it has less sublimity. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins>
gives us here a mother-hen, who could face the Madonna of
the Chair. She bends over with solicitude, with outspread
wings, beneath which peep the excited heads of the little
chickens; while on her back is perched the privileged <i>bambino</i>:
she does not dare move, the good mother!"</p></div>

<p>A picture of Cock and Hens by his father, Gijsbert
d'<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins> (1604-53), was acquired in 1876. He was
the teacher of his more talented son, who also studied with
his uncle, Jan Baptist Weenix (1621-60), no pictures of
whom are owned by the Mauritshuis.</p>

<p><b>Jan Weenix's Tasteful Compositions.</b>&mdash;Two pictures of
Jan Weenix (1640-1719) hang in this gallery and are good
examples. One is The Dead Swan, the other is Game.
Though Weenix painted portraits, landscapes, and even seaports,
his chief works represent dead animals, the size of
life. Peacocks, pheasants, partridges, geese, and most frequently
swans, figure in his pictures. Sometimes, too, he
introduces a living dog and paints it in the most spirited
manner. Weenix had great taste in composition and arranged
his models (more often dead than living) around the
base of a handsome vase or urn in a beautiful park.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Reynolds and Blanc on Jan Weenix's Paintings.</b>&mdash;"What
excellence in coloring and handling is to be found in the
dead game of Weenix!" exclaimed Sir Joshua Reynolds, who
declared that he saw no less than twenty dead swans by this
painter during his walks through the Holland galleries. "In
his works of small dimensions," says Blanc, "his execution
is delicate and caressing; but it is broad and accentuated in
his decorative paintings. At his best he was the equal of his
father, which is no small praise."</p>

<p><b>Jan David de Heem, the Greatest of the Group of Fruit
and Flower Painters.</b>&mdash;First in this group comes Jan
David de Heem (1606-03 or 04), the pupil of his father,
David de Heem, and not only the first to develop the art
of fruit-painting, but the greatest master of the class that
the school produced. In the beautiful arrangement of his
subjects he has been compared to Giovanni da Udine. He
is also a great colorist; some of his early works approach
Rembrandt in their golden tone.</p>

<p>Although his two most important works are in the galleries
of Vienna and Berlin, and splendid examples hang in
the Louvre, Dresden, and Cassel, the Mauritshuis owns two
very fine examples. One is a Table with Fruits, very
tasteful in arrangement and soft in treatment; the other is
a Garland of Flowers and Fruits, enlivened with insects.</p>

<p>When Sir Joshua Reynolds visited the Prince of Orange's
collection, he saw these pictures and noted: "Fruits by De
Heem, done with the utmost perfection."</p>

<p><b>His Greatness as a Painter of Fruits, Flowers, and
Insects.</b>&mdash;De Heem was one of the greatest painters of
still life in Holland; no artist of his class combined form
and color more successfully. His drawing is correct, and
his colors are brilliant and combined harmoniously. He is
familiar with every object of stone and silver, every flower,
whether humble or gorgeous, every fruit of Europe or the
tropics, every twig and leaf and blossom. Burger has said
of Heda, but it is true of De Heem, that "he glorified
insects, butterflies, and all the minute beings that swarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in vegetation, and made the moths drink in cups of chased
gold."</p>

<p><b>His Pictures that point a Moral.</b>&mdash;De Heem was also
famous for his pictures that point a moral or illustrate
a motto&mdash;those canvases known as Vanitas. Here the
snake lies coiled under the grass; there a skull rests on
blooming plants. "Gold and silver tankards or cups suggest
the vanity of earthly possessions; salvation is allegorized in
a chalice amid blossoms; death, as a crucifix inside a wreath."
Sometimes De Heem painted alone, or with men of his
school, Madonnas or portraits surrounded by festoons of
fruits and flowers. He was so fond of the festoon that he
sometimes painted it alone. Sometimes, too, a nosegay is
figured alone.</p>

<p><b>Cornelis de Heem's Subjects like those of his Father.</b>&mdash;The
Hague Gallery also owns Fruits by his son Cornelis
(1631-95). The latter painted precisely the same
subjects as his father and with scarcely less success. Still
life, flowers, fruits, oysters, and lemons on a plate; cold
hams, boiled lobsters, flowers, knives, forks, glasses, watches,
clocks, etc., are all treated by him with the utmost cleverness.
Crowe says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He is not inferior to his father in drawing and warmth of
color, and with an equally solid impasto, almost surpasses him
in melting softness of touch. He is, however, in rare instances,
somewhat gaudier. Under these circumstances it is easy to
understand that his works are often mistaken for those of his
father."</p></div>

<p><b>Abraham Mignon, Pupil and Imitator of De Heem.</b>&mdash;Another
pupil was Abraham Mignon (1640-79), who is represented
in the Mauritshuis by Flowers and Fruits, and two
canvases called Summer Flowers, which show the influence
of his master. Mignon's fruits and flowers have all the
bloom of nature; his butterflies and other insects seem to
live and feed on the leaves, buds, and blossoms; and the
dewdrops on the leaves and petals have all the transparency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of real water. He was very popular in his day and was
overwhelmed with commissions.</p>

<p><b>Jacob Walscapelle.</b>&mdash;Jacob Walscapelle is also supposed
to have been a pupil of De Heem, and many of his pictures
have been attributed to one of the De Heems.</p>

<p><b>Maria van Oosterwyck, an Excellent Painter of
Flowers.</b>&mdash;Another pupil was Maria van Oosterwyck
(1630-93), who usually painted flowers in vases or glasses,
and occasionally fruits. In 1882 the Mauritshuis acquired
a picture of Flowers, by this artist, who, perhaps, because of
the rarity of her pictures, is not so widely known as she
deserves to be. Although her flowers are not always arranged
with taste and the colors are often gaudy, yet Crowe
thinks she represents them with the</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"utmost truth of drawing, and with a depth, brilliancy, and
juiciness of local coloring unattained by any other flower-painter.
At the same time, her execution, in spite of great finish, is broad
and free, and the impasto excellent."</p></div>

<p>She was much admired in her day and received commissions
from Louis XIV., William III. of England, Augustus I.
of Poland, and the Emperor Leopold.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Jan <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Vanhuysum,' 'Van Huysum,' and 'Huysum' were used in this text. This was retained.">van Huysum</ins>, the Correggio of Flowers and Fruits.</b>&mdash;"If
De Heem, by the harmony of his warm golden color, be
called the Titian of flowers and fruits, Jan van Huysum's bright
and sunny treatment entitles him to the name of the Correggio
of the same branch of art. In masterly drawing and truth of
single objects, both masters may be classed on the same level,
only that De Heem's principal subjects were fruit; Van Huysum's
were flowers, in which he entered into greater detail; for
instance, in the gloss of the tulip, the pollen of the auricula, and
the dewdrop on the petal. It is to these merits, fitted as they
are to the capacity of the greater number of admirers of art,
that Van Huysum owed the eager demand for, and high payment
of his pictures by princes and wealthy amateurs, even in
his own day, and also that of all painters of his class he still
commands the highest prices."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></div>

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Vanhuysum,' 'Van Huysum,' and 'Huysum' were used in this text. This was retained.">Van Huysum</ins>'s Pictures in The Hague.</b>&mdash;Jan van Huysum
(1682-1749) is not so well represented in his own
country as in the Louvre (which contains eleven fine examples),
Berlin, St. Petersburg, Munich, Hanover, and
Dresden. The Rijks owns but six, and The Hague only
three,&mdash;an Italian Landscape, Fruits, and Flowers. The
two latter are such beautiful examples of Van Huysum's art
that they deserve study. In the one are found that marvellous
blush and downy bloom for which he was so famous,
while the other reveals his delicate treatment of petals and
his graceful arrangement. In Fruits, a peach, two plums,
a small bunch of grapes and some gooseberries are beautifully
grouped, as to form and color, on a marble table. Its
pendant, Flowers, is an exquisite picture of a full-blown
rose and a rosebud, a pink and a convolvulus, placed on a
marble console. A butterfly of the admiral variety has
alighted on the rosebud.</p>

<p><b>His Earliest Works.</b>&mdash;In his earliest period he painted
landscapes representing views of imaginary lakes and harbors,
woods with tall, lifeless trees, and classic buildings
and ruins&mdash;finished in a glossy and smooth style&mdash;which
are now of little value in comparison with his fruit and
flower pieces. The Italian Landscape, which the Mauritshuis
acquired in 1816, is a very good example of this
style.</p>

<p><b>Fruits and Flowers his Forte.</b>&mdash;It is doubtful if any
artist ever surpassed <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Vanhuysum,' 'Van Huysum,' and 'Huysum' were used in this text. This was retained.">Van Huysum</ins> in the representation of
fruits and flowers, to which he finally devoted himself with
the greatest success. He set himself the task of surpassing
De Heem and Abraham Mignon; and he studied the most
exquisite fruits and flowers known. His taste in the arrangement
of his groups in elegant vases, of which the
ornaments and bas-reliefs were finished in the most polished
and beautiful manner, and in graceful baskets on
marble tables, is generally considered to be superior to
that of any other flower-painter. He also shows great art
in relieving flowers of various colors against each other, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
often they stand out from a light transparent background.
His fame rose to the highest pitch, and the first florists of
Holland were ambitious of supplying him with their choicest
flowers for subjects. Naturally, therefore, we find on his
canvases beautiful groups and bunches of hyacinths, roses,
pinks, primroses, and other garden buds and blossoms.</p>

<p><b>His Skill in depicting Dewdrops and Insects.</b>&mdash;With
marvellous skill he frequently introduces dewdrops of incomparable
transparency that trickle down the leaves or sprinkle
the fresh delicate petals. Butterflies and other insects are
also depicted with a truthfulness and precision that give
a perfect illusion, and often a bird's nest with eggs is
introduced.</p>

<p><b>His Exquisite Taste.</b>&mdash;Jan <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Vanhuysum,' 'Van Huysum,' and 'Huysum' were used in this text. This was retained.">van Huysum</ins>'s pictures are
so bright that they have even been accused of being gaudy;
but no critic has yet found fault with his exquisite taste
and faultless velvet-like finish that seems to rival nature.
His fruit pieces are inferior to his flowers, though they are
worthy of great admiration. Those painted on a clear or
yellow background are the most esteemed, and are distinguished
from his early works, which are usually on a dark
one, by a superior style of pencilling and a more harmonious
color.</p>

<p><b>Rachel Ruijsch.</b>&mdash;Another charming flower and fruit
painter,&mdash;noted especially for her flowers,&mdash;Rachel
Ruijsch (1664-1750), is represented in The Hague Gallery
by two Bouquets. In 1693 she was married, but she
always signed her maiden name, and in several ways,&mdash;Ruijsch,
Ruysch, and Ruisch. She took great pains with
her pictures, and the amount of time spent on them limited
their number. She is said to have given seven years to two
pictures, Flowers and Fruits, which she gave to one of her
daughters for a wedding present.</p>

<p>Blanc has most sympathetically described her qualities.
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Her Truthfulness to Nature.</b>&mdash;"Whether she is painting
the flowers of the gardens or those of the field, which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
groups so beautifully on marble tables and calls around them
fluttering butterflies and droning bees, or beautiful ripe fruits
that refresh the eyes and mind, Rachel is always truthful, graceful,
and clever. A colorist, she frankly selects the brightest
tones and combines them marvellously; a draughtsman, she
reproduces splendidly the most complicated forms, while preserving
to each plant its individual elegance, its aspect, its way
of holding itself, and foreshortening."</p>

<p><b>Her Love of Nature.</b>&mdash;"In all justice, therefore, the Dutch
rank Rachel Ruijsch among their most excellent painters. She
retained her love of nature in all its freshness; it even seems
as if she had a weakness for rustic beauty, and that she found
the same pleasure in wandering about the country that others
have in gardens and greenhouses. Sometimes she even mingles
thistles with her field flowers, which she carelessly throws
on a table; sometimes she chooses an old tree-trunk overgrown
with moss, upon which she places her bunch of spring blossoms,
while the insects hum around them, and the wings of a
beetle gleam through the shadow. Sometimes she brings a
green frog from some pool in the neighboring meadow and
gives him a place in her picture. In the infinite little world of
great nature Rachel finds no creature unworthy of her brush&mdash;not
even the snail that crawls on the leaf and is hunted away
by the gardener, nor the little worm who moves his variegated
rings and spins his thread, destined to clothe magnificent ladies,
as he elevates himself into the air. Those insects that we
deem vile she honors in her paintings: she lets them lie on her
marble tables, crawl on the stem of the glass in which her
peonies and pinks are arranged; and she even allows them to
devour the plums and grapes of her picturesque collations.
Nothing, however, is more charming than her birds' nests,
lined with lightest down and tiny blades of grass, moss, and
straw, expressed with the art and industry of a wren or a
tomtit."</p></div>

<p>The larger picture in The Hague Gallery is a charming
group of roses and tulips, with butterflies and insects.</p>

<p>Rachel Ruijsch was a pupil of Willem van Aelst (1626-83?),
whose Flowers (dated 1663) and Still Life (dated
1671) hang in The Hague Gallery.</p>

<p><b>Description of One of Willem van Aelst's Pictures.</b>&mdash;M.
de Burtin has described a picture by Willem van Aelst
which gives an idea of all the works of this master:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A table covered with a crimson velvet carpet bordered
with golden fringe, on which stands a drinking-vessel of antique
shape half filled with Rhine wine. The sides of this glass
cup reflect several times and in different views the street with
the most magical and astounding way, and in the very centre
you see the reflection of the painter himself, holding his palette.
On one side of the cup are placed, on a glass dish, four superb
peaches and some roasted chestnuts; on the other side are
bunches of red and white grapes. Butterflies and other insects
add to the illusion, and the vine and peach leaves are artistically
used to decorate the beautiful pyramidal group that stands out
from a looped-back curtain of brownish yellow."</p></div>

<p><b>Resemblance of his Work to that of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Vanhuysum,' 'Van Huysum,' and 'Huysum' were used in this text. This was retained.">Van Huysum</ins>.</b>&mdash;Although
his name is less celebrated than that of
Van Huysum, Willem Aelst is not very far removed from him in
his beautiful productions; and certainly he surpasses Evert
van Aelst (1602-58) who was his uncle and master.
Without carrying finish to excess and preserving a certain
freedom of touch, he knows how to express marvellously
the delicate wings of a butterfly, the down of a
peach, the dewdrops on a bunch of grapes, the feathers of
a dead bird, and the wrinkles of a game-pouch.</p>

<p><b>In Favor with Princes and Cardinals.</b>&mdash;Many of his
works are in France, where he spent four years, and in
Italy, where he lived seven years filling orders for princes
and cardinals. He was only thirty years old when he returned
to his native town, Delft; but he removed to Amsterdam,
where his works brought high prices.</p>

<p><b>His Favorite Subjects.</b>&mdash;The pictures by him representing
dead birds are, as respects picturesque arrangement,
finely balanced harmony of cool but transparent color,
perfect nature in every detail, and delicate, soft treatment,
admirable types of the perfection of the Dutch School.
Specimens of this class are a picture in the Munich Gallery
of two dead partridges and instruments of the chase,
and another in the Berlin Museum signed "W. v. Aelst,
1653," representing a marble table with two woodcocks
and other small birds, and two French partridges suspended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
above. His favorite subjects, however, were fruit and
other eatables, herrings, oysters, bread, etc., with glasses and
gorgeous vessels in gold and silver. Although Willem van
Aelst owed much to his uncle Evert van Aelst, so famous
for his dead birds and instruments of the chase, perhaps
he owed still more to his other teacher, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Otho Marcellis' and 'Otto Marseus' (or vice versa) were used in this text. This was retained.">Otho Marcellis</ins> van
Schrieck (1613-73), who acquired celebrity, excelling in a
singular branch of art. He painted the humblest creatures,&mdash;frogs,
snails, lizards, worms, serpents, and curious plants.
The name of his master is unknown; but he painted
entirely from nature and is said to have kept a kind of
museum of serpents, vipers, insects and other curiosities.
These he studied with great attention, and drew them with
extraordinary fidelity and care, reproducing also their glowing
and metallic hues.</p>

<p><b>Two Pictures by Beijeren, and Two by Seghers.</b>&mdash;Another
famous Flowers is that by Abraham van Beijeren (1620
or 1621-75), which was acquired at the Van Pappelendam
sale in Amsterdam in 1889. A fine Fish and Lobster by
the same painter should also be studied. The visitor will
perhaps notice as he passes two pictures by Daniel Seghers
(1590-1661), one a garland of flowers around a statuette
of the Virgin; the other, a garland of flowers around the
bust of William III. The bust was a later addition.</p>

<p><b>Other Painters belonging to the Same Group.</b>&mdash;An interesting
and curious work is Shells, by Balthasar van der
Ast (?-1656). There is also a still life (1644) by Pieter
Claez. To this group should be added Pieter Roestraeten
(1627-1700), famous for his great vases of gold and silver,
bas-reliefs, musical instruments, etc., which he designed
with precision. He spent most of his time in London,
where he was injured in the Great Fire (1666). Belonging
to the same group are Pieter de Ring and Willem Kalf,
whom we shall see in the Rijks, and the strange Christoffel
Pierson, whose specialty was still life (particularly the attributes
of the chase) and portraits. His works are very rare;
but a peculiar combination of portraiture and still life hangs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in The Hague Gallery, representing the pastor of the Protestant
Church at Hoorn, Joris Goethals, and noticeable for
the number of hunting implements and objects hanging on
the wall. Though sombre and monotonous in tone, his
touch and drawing are masterly. He thoroughly understood
composition and distributed lights and shadows with
skill. Pierson was turned aside from painting historical subjects
and portraits by the success of Leemens, a painter of
dead game, guns, etc., and speedily surpassed his model.</p>

<p>Jan van Os, Georgius Jacobus Johannes van Os, and
Marie Margrita van Os we shall see in the Rijks.</p>

<p><b>Portrait of Rubens's Second Wife.</b>&mdash;Although Holland
is not the land where we can study Rubens (1577-1640) in
all his greatness, yet the Amsterdam Gallery and more particularly
The Hague Gallery possess some splendid pictures
by his hand. In the latter hang the portraits of his two
wives. That of his second wife, the buxom Helena, whom
he married on December 6, 1630, and who bore him five
children, is a masterpiece of the first rank; certainly an
entirely individual work of the artist's later period.</p>

<p><b>Much of Rubens's Work done by his Pupils.</b>&mdash;Thus we
immediately come to the question: What has the master
himself and what have his pupils done on it? No master
has left behind him a larger amount of painted surface of
canvas and wood; but how unequal is the artistic value
of all this material! We know how that happened. Overwhelmed
with pressing orders and surrounded by a large
throng of sometimes very able pupils, he often only made
a sketch, leaving the chief work to his best pupils, and
finally adding a few corrections; perhaps here or there a
head or a figure that particularly interested him. Rubens
made no secret of this fact; he often openly acknowledged
what he and what his scholars had done on a work.</p>

<p><b>Dr. Sperling's Visit to Rubens's Studio.</b>&mdash;An eye-witness,
the Danish physician, Otto Sperling, who visited Rubens's
studio in 1621, describes the master as walking up and
down in his vast hall among his many pupils, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
remarks and going over a picture here and there finally with
a few brush-strokes. The Doctor jocularly adds: "It is supposed
that everything is the work of Rubens, by which this
man has amassed enormous wealth, and has been rewarded
by kings and princes with great gifts and many jewels."</p>

<p><b>His Pupils not very often allowed to assist him in
Portraits.</b>&mdash;One should remember that this assistance of
his pupils was generally confined to his greater historical
pictures and church pieces; but the portraits that Rubens
painted are not always entirely the work of his hand. Sometimes
an order for a portrait was repeated, and his students
made the replica of a well-known personality. Rubens
painted portraits of small dimensions and then left them to
be enlarged by able pupils; but he himself added the final
touches.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Dr. Bredius on the Portraits of Rubens's Two Wives.</b>&mdash;"Even
in the case of the portrait of one of his wives, we are not
quite sure whether the work is exclusively his own. There
exist such a marvellous number of these portraits, and, moreover,
of such varied artistic value, that we must at last conclude
that the family and friends of these ladies, who belonged to the
best families in Antwerp, all ordered portraits from Rubens,
who painted some of them entirely and others only in part.</p>

<p>"While, for example, the present portrait of Rubens's first
wife, Isabella Brandt, whom he married in 1609, betrays the
master's own hand in the head and in part of the costume, the
hands look to me to be so extraordinarily like Van Dijck's work
that I ask myself whether the latter (about 1618) might not
have had some part in this portrait. On the other hand, the
portrait of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Helena Fourment' and 'Eleanor Forman' were used in this text. This was retained.">Helena Fourment</ins>, whom he married in 1630 (Isabella
Brandt died in 1626) is handled with such a gush, although very
rapidly and with such geniality that hardly anybody would say
that this spirited portrait is not all his own.</p>

<p>"What flesh! what brilliance! what glow of color! what virtuosity
in the painting of the details and the material! What
life streams from this warm, youthful, proud wife upon her
husband!"</p></div>

</div>

<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds describes these portraits thus: "Two
portraits, Kitcat size, by Rubens, of his two wives, both fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
portraits, but <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Helena Fourment' and 'Eleanor Forman' were used in this text. This was retained.">Eleanor Forman</ins> is by far the most beautiful
and the best colored."</p>

<p><b>Description of Helena's Portrait.</b>&mdash;This is one of the
most beautiful of all Rubens's portraits of his second wife.
Her face and figure are not only wonderfully modelled and
painted, but her red mouth has a sweet, half-smiling expression,
and dimples are ready to break out at any moment
and render the brilliant face even more brilliant. The eyes
are lustrous and handsome, beneath finely arched brows.
The light silky hair is roped with pearls, and a long plume
falls gracefully from the coquettish toque of velvet adjusted
at an angle that suits the face exactly. A pearl necklace
and earrings adorn the ears and snowy neck, a magnificent
jewel with three pear-shaped pearls for pendants clasps the
front of the dress, jewels ornament the sleeves, and a great
rope of goldsmith's work passes from shoulder to shoulder.
She wears a light blue satin dress the sleeves of which are
slashed with white, and a black velvet cloak with gold buttons
and a fur collar. The sleeves end with delicate filmy
frills at the wrist, and she gracefully holds in her hand a
couple of beautiful pink roses. The background is gray and
the curtain is red. This picture was painted in 1634, four
years after Rubens's marriage to the daughter of Daniel
Fourment.</p>

<p>After Rubens's death the beautiful Helena was married to
Jan B. Broekhoven, Baron of Bergeijck. She died in 1673.</p>

<p><b>Burger's Admiration for the Portrait of the First Wife.</b>&mdash;Not
far away from her portrait hangs that of Isabella
Brandt, painted in 1620. Burger admired it more than
that of Helena, and went into ecstasies over the "beautiful
hands" crossed over her girdle. Isabella is dressed in
black, with a square and low-cut bodice and a gauze fichu.
Her hair is adorned with pearls.</p>

<p><b>Portrait of Father Ophovius.</b>&mdash;The Mauritshuis possesses
also a famous portrait by Rubens of quite another
character; this is that of a friend whom he had sufficient
influence to have made Bishop of Bois-le-Duc, the Rev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Father Michael Ophovius, a Dominican monk. He is seen
full face in the costume of his order. He has an energetic
head and is in robust health. It is a broad and vigorous
painting, and formerly adorned the Dominican monastery
at Antwerp.</p>

<p><b>Two Pictures painted Partly by Rubens.</b>&mdash;Two other
pictures by Rubens should be studied. Adam and Eve in
Paradise, in which, however, only the figures are by Rubens
(Dr. Bredius thinks the horse also); while the landscape
and other animals are by Jan Brueghel, also called Velvet
Brueghel. The latter also painted the landscape in the
Naiads Filling the Horn of Plenty, a picture that was once
attributed to Van Bolen, but now to Rubens. It is interesting
to compare the landscape of the Terrestrial Paradise
by Jan Brueghel (Velvet) with the landscapes in the above-mentioned
pictures.</p>

<p>Copies of six pictures by Rubens are also owned by this
gallery.</p>

<p><b>Portraits by Van Dijck in The Hague.</b>&mdash;There are only
three portraits by Van Dijck (1599-1641) in The Hague
Gallery: Portrait of Sir &mdash;&mdash; Sheffield, painted in 1627; a
Portrait of Anna Wake, his Wife, painted in 1628; and a
Portrait of the painter, Quintijn Simons. Of the latter, Sir
Joshua Reynolds said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A portrait by Van Dyck of Simon the painter. This is one
of the very few pictures that can be seen of Van Dyck which is
in perfect preservation; and on examining it closely it appeared
to me a perfect pattern of portrait-painting: every part is distinctly
marked, but with the lightest hand and without destroying
the breadth of light; the coloring is perfectly true to nature,
though it has not the brilliant effect of sunshine, such as is seen
in Rubens's wife; it is nature seen by common daylight."</p></div>

<p><b>A Picture by Frans <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Frans 'Snijders,' 'Snyders,' 'Snyder,' and 'Synders' were used in this text. This was retained.">Snijders</ins>.</b>&mdash;Anthonie van Dijck is
said to have painted the huntsman in the picture of still life
and game by which Frans Snijders is represented here.
Fuller knowledge of Snijders, however, is to be gained in
the Rijks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p><b>A Picture by Several Artists.</b>&mdash;One of the most curious
and interesting pictures in the entire gallery is The Interior
of a Picture Gallery, painted by a number of Antwerp artists,
but which is catalogued under the name of Gonzales Coques
(1618-84). This artist and his family are represented in
the centre of a picture gallery, and are by the hand of
Coques himself. The pictures on the walls were painted
by pupils of Rubens, Van Dijck, Rembrandt, and others,
and represent still life, landscapes, mythological and allegorical
scenes. Many of them possess great charm. On the
left are: the Meeting of Christ and a Centurion, by Pieter
Yykens (1648-95); The Earth, an allegory, by Erasmus
Quellinus (1607-78); an Italian Landscape, by Antoni
Goubau (1616-98); The Metamorphosis of Ascalaphus,
by Carel Emanuel Biset (1633-after 1691); A Boar Hunt,
by Peter Boel (1622-89); a Moonlight and Landscape,
signed J. v. K.; a Landscape, by Pieter van Bredael (1629-1719),
signed P. v. B.; a Marine (unknown); The Nymphs
Spied On, by Jan de Duyts (1629-76); and a Marine,
by Jan Peeters (1624-77). Above the door in the
centre are two pictures: The Judgment of Paris, by
Theodoor Boeyermans (1620-78), and Leda, by the same
artist. On the left: The Triumph of Silenus, by Jan Cossiers
(1600-71); Water, an allegory, by Theodoor Boeyermans;
the Four Seasons, by the same artist; a Landscape
(unknown); Still Life (unknown); The Descent from the
Cross and View of a City, both by Johan van den Hecke
(1620-84); Landscape (unknown); a Village Festival, by
Peter Spierinckx (1635-1711); a Landscape, by Johan van
den Hecke (1620-84), and Bathers, by the same artist;
Still Life, by Peter Gysels (1621-90); and a Venus and
Adonis, by Casper Jacob van Opstal (1654-1717). The
architecture of the room was painted in 1674 by Willem van
Ehrenberg (1637-about 76). The picture is 5-3/4 feet high
by 7 feet broad, and was offered in 1683 by the Brotherhood
of Painters in Antwerp to Jan van Bavegom, Procureur
of the Court of Brussels, as a reward for the services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
he had rendered to the Brotherhood in the lawsuit against
the armies of the Six Guilds. It finally became the property
of William V.</p>

<p><b>"The Little Van Dijck."</b>&mdash;Gonzales Coques was a pupil
of Pieter Brueghel III. and David Ryckaert, whose daughter
he married. He was fond of painting portraits of his
family walking in a park or engaged in various occupations
and pleasures indoors; and very frequently he was assisted
by other artists, as in the case of the picture just described.
Coques was a man of letters, and presided over the Chamber
of Rhetoric in his native city, Antwerp. His elegance,
taste, and delicacy have procured for him the name of
"The Little Van Dijck." In his own day he enjoyed
great renown, and was honored with orders for pictures
and presents from many sovereigns, including Charles I. of
England, the Prince of Orange, and the Archdukes of
Austria.</p>

<p><b>Francken, Painter of Allegories and Festive Scenes.</b>&mdash;A
historical picture of interest is that of A Ball at the Court
of Albert and Isabella in 1611, by Frans Francken the
Younger (1581-1642). He was famous for his scenes from
the Bible, allegories, landscapes, mythological pictures,
and particularly for his balls, masquerades, and other scenes
of festivity in which he introduced figures of small size.
Frequently, too, he painted figures in the pictures of the
elder Neeffs, the younger De Momper, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Bartelmees,' 'Bartholomew,'and 'Bartholomeus' van Bassen were used in this text. This was retained.">Bartelmees</ins> van
Bassen.</p>

<p><b>Description of the Picture of a Historical Ball.</b>&mdash;This
ball scene, which belonged to William V. at Het Loo, was
painted between 1611 and 1616. The couple who are
dancing in the centre are Philip William of Nassau, Prince
of Orange, and his wife, Eleonore de Bourbon, Princess of
Cond&eacute;. Albert and his wife, Isabelle Claire Eug&eacute;nie, and
five other portraits are by the hand of Frans Pourbus the
Younger.</p>

<p><b>Pictures by Vinck Boons and Droochsloot.</b>&mdash;Pictures
of peasants enjoying the <i>kermesse</i>, by David Vinck Boons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
(1578-1629), (1622), a landscape and genre painter, whose
figures are often of repulsive ugliness, and by J. C. Droochsloot
(1586-1666), also represented by a Dutch Village
(1652), bring us to a more brilliant painter of such scenes.</p>

<p><b>David Teniers the Younger a Conspicuous Painter of
Still Life.</b>&mdash;David Teniers the Younger (1610-90) is one
of those Flemish painters who were known and sought
after in Holland during their lifetime. This may have
arisen from the fact that he was closely allied with the Dutch
school and with Brouwer, who lived and worked for a long
time in Holland and was very highly prized there. Teniers
painted in particular little cabinet pictures, soldier scenes,
alchemists and cooks, and in them often showed a conspicuous
love of still life, so greatly liked in Holland. Another
circumstance which must be taken into consideration is that
his brothers Hendrik and Julius, both painters, lived for
some time in Holland and occupied themselves&mdash;the former
in Middelburg and the latter in Amsterdam&mdash;with the sale
of the pictures of their famous brother.</p>

<p><b>The Resemblance of his Pictures to those of his Master.</b>&mdash;The
younger Teniers developed himself principally in
the school of Adriaen Brouwer. Some of his early pictures,
painted between 1630 and 1640, stand so closely sometimes
beside those of Brouwer that they have been attributed to
the latter. In his first period, Teniers, quite trickily copied
Brouwer's real types, and many of his mannerisms, such as
the famous red cap which he so often put on his figures.
The spirited painting, the clear bright light with the finely
expressed chiaroscuro, and the beautiful harmony of tone
he followed in the happiest way. He became Brouwer's
successor; and he is greatest when he is still under the
inspiration of his great prototype. Splendid pictures of
this style are possessed by the Museums of Madrid, the
Louvre, Berlin, Dresden, St. Petersburg, and many of the
great private collections.</p>

<p><b>A Gradual Change in the Tone of Teniers's Pictures.</b>&mdash;About
1650 the warm golden tone of the master falls more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and more into a cooler silver tone. Bright and clear in the
highest degree are the treasured works of this period. At
the end of his life, however, he grades more and more into
a brown, dull tone far removed from the vigor and transparency
of his youth. Still in his old age he maintained a
careful drawing, a great completeness in the painting, only
the very last pictures show that the hand of the old man at
length had begun to tremble.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Good Kitchen.</b>&mdash;The Hague possesses
two fine examples of this artist. In The Good Kitchen,
a splendid work of his middle period, painted in 1644, he
delights us especially with masterly representation of assembled
details. Magnificently painted are the fish and fowl,
pots and kitchen stuff; only, perhaps, is the background
keyed up a little too high. The figures, as unfortunately so
frequently happens with Teniers, are somewhat uninteresting;
only the little boy who is holding the dish for his
mother (evidently the portrait of a child) looks out at us in
a lifelike and endearing manner.</p>

<p>A famous kitchen it is, in fact; and it is evident that a
feast of some consequence is in preparation. Fowl, game,
fish, vegetables, fruits, all are there on the tables and the
floor. In the background, before a big fire, a cook is roasting
joints, and a man and woman are very busy close beside
him. In front, in the middle, and in the bright light,
is seated the young mistress of the house, also aiding in the
preparations. For the moment she is peeling a lemon, and
the little boy is standing beside her holding a plate. She
wears a blood-colored skirt, and on her sky-blue bodice
expands a broad collar of a whiteness that Metsu would
envy. The whole is very ably and broadly painted with
that just and free touch and those spirited accents which
characterize the technique of Teniers. It is painted at the
beginning of his best period when his silvery period begins:
he was then thirty-four years old.</p>

<p>Burger cleverly says: "Like certain of those fishes that
he has painted so well, Teniers is excellent between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
head and tail." The Good Kitchen is painted on copper
and is only two feet and a half broad. A small picture on
wood shows an alchemist with a gray beard seated beside a
table holding a book. His assistant is kneeling beside a
furnace.</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The works of David Teniers, Jun., are worthy the closest
attention of a painter who desires to excel in the mechanical
knowledge of his art. His manner of touching, or what we call
handling, has perhaps never been equalled: there is in his pictures
that exact mixture of softness and sharpness which is
difficult to execute."</p></div>

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Tilborch' and 'Tilborgh' were used in this text. This was retained.">Tilborgh</ins>'s Picture of A Dinner.</b>&mdash;We must not neglect
now to look at the one picture by Tilborgh, A Dinner, particularly
interesting on account of the personages represented.</p>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Tilborch' and 'Tilborgh' were used in this text. This was retained.">Tilborgh</ins> (1625-78), supposed to have been a pupil of

than Teniers himself. The dinner is taking place in the
home of Adriaen van Ostade, who is seated in the middle,
with his wife on his right, beyond whom are a man and a
woman. On the left is Paul Potter, with long hair and
a large hat, dressed in a pearl-gray doublet and red stockings.
His general appearance is very gay, and quite a contrast
to the melancholy portrait by B. van der Helst, which
also hangs in this gallery. Near Potter stands his silly little
wife, dressed in light blue,&mdash;a not specially graceful figure.
Two other painters are standing on the left, talking together.
Burger thinks they may be Tilborgh himself and Isaak van
Ostade.</p>

<h2>THE RIJKS MUSEUM</h2>

<h3>THE WAY TO THE RIJKS</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>On taking the tramway at the Dam, the traveller will
find the short trip to the Rijks Museum a very pleasant
one. The car glides rapidly through a busy part of
Amsterdam, crossing canal after canal,&mdash;the Singel, Heeren,
Keizers, and Prinsen grachts,&mdash;bordered with leafy trees and
houses that present a picturesque appearance. Alighting at
Willems Park, on the canal long known as the Buiten Singel,
or outer girdle, separating the old from the new town, we
walk a short distance along the Stadhouders-Kade to the
imposing red brick building with granite bands, arches,
tympans, entablatures, etc., in the transition style between
the Gothic and the Dutch Renaissance, which covers nearly
three acres of ground. The principal <i>fa&ccedil;ade</i>, turned toward
the Buiten Singel, presents a somewhat majestic appearance,
with its two fine towers and central gable surmounted by a
statue of Victory, by Vermeylen.</p>

<p><b>History of this Collection.</b>&mdash;Before entering, we may
note that this splendid Museum was opened in the name
of the King of Holland in 1885. Perhaps we may pause
also to recall the history and development of this great collection,
which was formed of the remnant of the pictures
and curiosities left by the last Stadtholder, William V.</p>

<p>In 1798 the Government decreed the formation of a
National Museum, and this was installed in the Huis ten
Bosch (House in the Wood), near The Hague, and opened
to the public in 1800. From time to time the collection
was increased by purchases, and in 1805 it received the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
name of Cabinet National. When the King of Holland
removed his residence, however, from Utrecht to Amsterdam,
in 1808, he ordered that a Royal Museum for the
preservation of pictures, drawings, prints, sculpture, carvings,
engraven gems, antiquities, and curiosities of all kinds
should be formed.</p>

<p><b>Opening of the Royal Museum in 1808.</b>&mdash;This Museum
was opened in the Palace on the Dam in December, 1808.
Here were gathered ninety-six pictures from the National
Museum of 1798 (one hundred and fifty-four remaining pictures
being sent to The Hague); fifty-seven pictures bought
in 1808 at the sale of G. van der Pot van Groeneveld in
Rotterdam; eight old pictures given by The Hague in 1808;
seven old pictures lent by the city of Amsterdam (among
them The Night Watch and Syndics and The Banquet of the
Civil Guard); six pictures and a marble statuette by J. B.
Xavery, given by Baron van Spaen de Biljoen; a few
modern pictures bought at the exposition of 1808; one
hundred and thirty-seven pictures forming the Van Heteren
Collection, bought in 1809 for 100,000 florins; and seven
pictures bought in the same year at the Bicker sale; several
casts of antique statues from the Mus&eacute;e Napol&eacute;on of Paris;
and some antiquities found chiefly in Drenthe.</p>

<p><b>Removal to the Trippenhuis.</b>&mdash;In 1810 the name was
changed from the "Royal Museum" to the "Dutch Museum,"
and in 1814 the collections were transferred to the
Trippenhuis, where they remained until 1885.</p>

<p><b>Numerous Additions from 1825 to 1885.</b>&mdash;In 1825
some pictures were exchanged with the Royal Museum at
The Hague (Mauritshuis); and in 1828 some duplicates
were sold for 23,701 florins, with which sum other pictures
were purchased. In 1828 William I. made a present of
some pictures he had acquired at the Brentano and Muller
sales to the State Museum, as it was now called.</p>

<p>In 1838 many of the modern pictures were transferred
to the Paviljoen Welgelegen, which became, therefore, a
gallery of the works of living painters of the Netherlands;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
and this collection was gradually enriched by gifts and purchases.
In 1885 the one hundred and eighty-four pictures
of this collection were sent to the Rijks.</p>

<p><b>Bequests.</b>&mdash;The principal bequests have been as follows:
Madame la Ve Balguerie Van Rijswijck, twenty-two family
portraits (1823); M. L. Dupper, Wz., sixty-four superb
pictures (1870); Mlle. J. E. Liotard, an enamel of great
value, and fifteen pastels by the Genevese painter, J. E.
Liotard, to which Mme. Liotard sent six other pastels by
the same artist in 1885 (1873); Jhr. Me. J. de Witte van
Citters some objects of art, curios, prints, and thirty-five
family portraits (1875); Mme. J. J. van Winter Bicker,
forty-four portraits of the Bicker family (1879); Jhr. J. S.
H. van de Poll, fifty-two pictures of great value (1880);
and a gift of Jhr. J. S. R. van de Poll, comprising thirty-five
family portraits.</p>

<p><b>Two Important Collections added.</b>&mdash;Two important collections
have yet to be mentioned: the famous Van der
Hoop Collection and The Collection of Contemporary Art.
The former was gathered by M. Adriaan van der Hoop,
head of the house of Hope &amp; Co., and knight of several
orders, who made a magnificent collection of about two
hundred and twenty-four ancient and modern pictures.
These he left to the city of Amsterdam in 1854. It was
lodged in the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux Arts until removed to
the Rijks in 1885. In 1880 Mme. Van der Hoop left
twenty-four more pictures, which had adorned her house,
to complete the gift. The Collection of Contemporary Art
is the work of an association of Amsterdam art-lovers
founded in 1875.</p>

<p><b>The Staircase and the Rembrandt Room.</b>&mdash;Before ascending
the stairs guarded by two lions couchant, we may
stop to notice a picture by Pieter Cornelisz van Rijck
(1568-16&mdash;), representing an old Dutch kitchen with all
sorts of eatables, and in the background a feast representing
the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. This staircase
leads to the Entrance Hall, from which we go to the Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Gallery, which leads directly into the famous Rembrandt
Room, in which The Night Watch holds the place of honor.
The Grand Gallery is bordered on each side by four compartments,
or cabinets, hung with pictures of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p><b>A Tour through the Rooms.</b>&mdash;To the left of the Rembrandt
Room is the Carlovingian Room; and from this we
pass into International Hall, where pictures of foreign masters
are gathered. In the next room are assembled the
oldest pictures of the Dutch School. The next room contains
masters of the sixteenth century, and next to it comes
Dupper Hall, devoted to the glorious period of Dutch art,
the seventeenth century. Here are sixty-four paintings,
many of which are masterpieces. Next comes Van der
Poll Hall with fifty-two pictures, then the Hall of Anatomy
Pictures, and next Portrait Hall. From this we visit the
five cabinets, containing such pictures of the Old Dutch
School as from their small dimensions and minute finish
are best seen in small rooms. On the opposite side of the
vestibule are five similar cabinets with similar pictures. Beyond
these is Pavilion Hall, containing portraits, many of
which are painters' portraits of themselves. Then come
the Van der Hoop <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Musuem'">Museum</ins> and two galleries of modern
pictures, one of which is called Waterloo Hall, because of
The Battle of Waterloo, by J. W. Pieneman, hanging there.
From this we enter the Old Dutch Governors' Room, representing
a typical room of the seventeenth century with allegorical
ceiling, tapestries, and old furniture. From this we
pass into the adjoining Gold Leather Room, where there is
a picture representing a marriage party, and a collection of
drinking vessels of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
in one of the cupboards. The Dutch Governors'
Room leads into the Rembrandt Room, which again leads
us into the Grand Gallery, our starting point.</p>

<p><b>Rembrandt's Work in his Middle and Last Periods.</b>&mdash;We
have seen in The Hague the great works of Rembrandt's
early period; in the Rijks we find the full flowering of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
genius in his middle and last periods. The Night Watch
was painted in 1642; the Portrait of Elizabeth Bas, about
1645; the fragment of the Anatomy picture, representing
Dr. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Deyman,' 'Deyment,' and 'Deeman' were used in this text. This was retained.">Deyman</ins>, in 1656; The Syndics, in 1661; and The
Jewish Bride, or Ruth and Boaz, about 1663. The Rijks
owns two other pictures: a mythological composition and
the head of his father, painted in Leyden in 1630.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Night Watch.</b>&mdash;Let us look carefully
at The Night Watch, Rembrandt's most famous picture
and also his largest (11 feet by 14). It was painted
in 1642, ten years after the Lesson in Anatomy, for the
Kloveniers Doele (Arquebusiers Shooting Company).</p>

<p>The great Sortie of the Banning Cock Company, which
is the more correct name for The Night Watch, represents
twenty-nine life-sized civic guards issuing from their guardhouse
in a great state of bustle and confusion, while the
drums beat and the dog barks. The dominant color is the
citron-yellow uniform of the lieutenant, wearing a blue sash,
while a Titian-like red dress of a musketeer, the black velvet
dress of the captain, and the varied green of the girl
and the drummer, all produce a rich and harmonious effect.
The background has become dark and heavy by accident
or neglect, and the scutcheon on which the names are
painted is scarcely to be seen.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In the middle, in front, marches the captain in a dark
brown, almost black, costume, at his side Lieutenant Willem
van Ruitenberg, in a yellow buffalo jerkin, both figures in
the full sunlight, so that the shadow of the captain's hand
is distinctly traceable on the jerkin. On the right hand of
the captain are an arquebusier loading his weapon, and two
children, of whom the one in front, a girl, has a dead cock
hanging from her girdle (perhaps one of the prizes). On
a step behind them is the flag-bearer, Jan Visser Cornelissen.
The other side of the picture is pervaded with similar life
and spirit, from the lieutenant to the drummer, Jan van
Kamboort, at the extreme corner, who energetically beats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
his drum. In an oval frame on a column in the background
are inscribed the names of the members of the
guild.</p>

<p><b>The Night Watch a Misnomer.</b>&mdash;The remarkable chiaroscuro
of the whole picture (seen to greatest advantage in
the afternoon) has led to the belief that Rembrandt intended
to depict a nocturnal scene; but the event represented
really takes place in daylight, the lofty vaulted hall
of the guild being lighted only by windows above, to the
left, not visible to the spectator, and being therefore properly
obscured in partial twilight. The peculiar light and the
spirited action of the picture elevate this group of portraits
into a most effective dramatic scene, which ever since its
creation has been enthusiastically admired by all connoisseurs
of art. Each guild member represented paid 100
florins for his portrait, so that, as there were originally
sixteen in the group, the painter received 1,600 florins for
his work. The painting was successfully cleaned by Hopman
in 1889.</p>

<p>The picture is so deeply enveloped in shadow that it is
some time before the spectator can see figures emerge,
although they always retain something of a supernatural
quality, derived partly from the phosphorescent gleams that
here and there illuminate faces, figures, drum, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'halberds' and 'halberts' were used in this text. This was retained.">halberds</ins>,
flag-pole, and lances.</p>

<p><b>The Mutilation of the Picture.</b>&mdash;When The Night Watch
was removed from the Kloveniers Doele to the small military
council chamber of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'town-hall' and 'town hall' were used in this text. This was retained.">Town Hall</ins> on the Dam, in
1715, portions of it were cut off on the right and left and
at the bottom, which has greatly interfered with its appearance.
A photograph of an old drawing hangs near the
picture, which shows the (supposed) original form of the
composition.</p>

<p><b>The Syndics.</b>&mdash;Some critics consider The Syndics Rembrandt's
greatest achievement; and all are agreed that it is
one of the finest groups of portraits ever painted. This
work, finished in 1662&mdash;twenty years after The Night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Watch&mdash;was ordered by the Guild of Clothmakers, who
wished to have a portrait group of their Syndics to hang
in their chamber at the Staalhof (sample hall) in the
Staalstraat in Amsterdam.</p>

<p><b>Rembrandt's Special Traits exhibited in this Picture.</b>&mdash;Here
Rembrandt's special traits are exhibited: his wonderful
treatment of light, his grouping of figures, and his
study of character. The five <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Snydics'">Syndics</ins>, all dressed alike in
black with flat white collars and broad-brimmed-high-crowned
hats, are grouped around a table verifying their
accounts. The yellow oak wainscot behind them and the
scarlet <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'table-cloth' and 'tablecloth' were used in this text. This was retained.">table-cloth</ins> contribute the only color to the sombre
group.</p>

<p>Six canvases of portraits of Syndics formerly hung in the
Staalhof, the oldest of which was painted in 1559. Only
two now remain: the one by Rembrandt, and another, also in
the Rijks, by Aert Pietersen, painted in 1599. Upon the
frame of the latter is a Dutch inscription, which, translated,
reads:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Consider your oath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In what you know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live uprightly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through favor or hatred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or self-interest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't give an opinion."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Rembrandt's five Dutch gentlemen look as if they had
closely followed this excellent moral advice.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Jewish Bride.</b>&mdash;The Jewish Bride
depicts two life-size figures, standing and seen to the knees,
one a young woman dressed in a red gown with white sleeves
and white cape. Her complexion is rosy, and she has an
abundance of brown hair. She is simply covered with
jewels,&mdash;a comb, earrings, collar, large chain, bracelets,
rings of pearls, and sparkling gems. Her face is tranquil
and radiant. Her gallant companion is about to embrace
her, his face full of tenderness. He wears a long wig with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
curls falling over his shoulders and has no beard; this was
the fashion after 1660. He has a large black cap on his
head, and his pourpoint, mantle, and wide and embroidered
sleeves are yellow. The head of the man is very highly
finished, slightly recalling in manner those in The Syndics;
but his clothing is somewhat hastily done. The picture is
unfinished, but in the dark fantastic background some
architecture with foliage and a vase of flowers suggesting a
park may be discerned to the left; also the vague form of a
dog. On the right, there are some shrubs and a wall.
Burger thinks this was painted in 1669, the last year of
Rembrandt's life. The canvas is about five feet long and
four feet high.</p>

<p><b>The Celebrated Portrait of Elizabeth Bas.</b>&mdash;The portrait
of Elizabeth Bas, the widow of Lieutenant Admiral Joachim
Swartenhout, painted in 1642, is considered one of Rembrandt's
most celebrated portraits. Seated in an easy chair
and wearing a rich dress profusely ornamented with buttons,
the stern, commanding face of the old lady looks directly at
the spectator. Her marvellously painted hands are folded
over a handkerchief, and she wears a cap and a fluted ruff.</p>

<p>Two other portraits by Rembrandt can be seen here:
one, of a lady; and the other, of his father (a copy).</p>

<p><b>Multiplicity of Portraits in the Rijks.</b>&mdash;In the Rijks
Gallery portraits, either single or groups, outnumber all
other branches of art. Some of these have a world-wide
reputation, while others are interesting only to the special
student. No less famous than Rembrandt's Elizabeth Bas
is that of another old lady, Maria Voogt, Madame van der
Meer, painted by Frans Hals in 1639, which hangs in the
Van der Hoop Room.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"An old woman is seated in an arm-chair almost full face and
of natural size. She is dressed in black velvet, with a white
ruff. Her right hand holds a book with a silver clasp, the left
hand rests on the arm of the chair. The tone is neutral. A superb
portrait of the first order. You read above the coat-of-arms
<i>&AElig;tatis su&aelig;</i> 64. <i>A<sup>o</sup></i> 1639."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Hals's Portrait of Himself and his Wife.</b>&mdash;Hals's portrait
of himself and his wife, Lysbeth Reyniers, represents the
couple as life-size and seated in a rather uncomfortable position
on a bank under the trees, in a garden ornamented
with statues and fountains. In the distance a peacock
struts; and the scene is so cheerful that the smiling faces of
Hals and his wife are quite explicable. The latter's ruff is
of enormous size and marvellously painted.</p>

<p><b>Hals's The Jester.</b>&mdash;Hals always loved to render the face
in action, to fix forever a rapid fleeting expression; and one
of his most notable achievements is the famous Jester owned
by Baron Rothschild in Paris. As few art lovers can ever
have the chance of seeing this masterpiece, the admirable
copy that hangs in the Rijks, said to have been made by
Dirck Hals, should be carefully examined. The canvas is
variously known as The Jester, The Fool, The Mandolin
Player, and The Lute Player; and is said to be a portrait of
the artist's pupil, Adriaen Brouwer; but whoever he is, he is
a rascally, impudent fellow with a mocking, cynical smile,
and belongs to the same class as Touchstone, Dogberry,
Launcelot Gobbo, and other of our prized and disreputable
Shakespearian acquaintances. Hals's Jester is a creation.
Look at the vagabond well, first because he will soon twang
the chords of his lute, break out into a song of the day,
then doff his cap and beg for money. Look at the pose of
his left hand and the strong, flexible thumb. He can <i>play</i>.
Next look at the artist's work and note the broad sweeps of
the brush that so simply but surely create the features and
expression.</p>

<p>A Jolly Man is another of Hals's pictures that may be
classed as portraits, a splendid piece of work. Go closely
up to the picture and notice how the broad brush strokes
are made.</p>

<span class="caption">MOREELSE<br />
The Little Princess</span>
</div>

<p><b>Moreelse's The Little Princess.</b>&mdash;A very charming portrait
is that of The Little Princess by Moreelse. The child
looks somewhat demurely at the spectator, with large brown
eyes. Her face is round, her forehead high, and her light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
brown hair, brushed severely from her face, is ornamented
with a pink rose held in place by a jewelled band. Her
large earrings are coral and pearl. A necklace and bracelets
of three rows of handsome pearls adorn her neck and
wrists, and a brooch containing a miniature set with jewels
fastens the rosette at the point of her collar. Her dress is
of dark green velvet embroidered with gold and fastened by
rich girdles and chains. Marvellously indeed has the artist
executed the lace and transparent lawn of which the "butterfly"
ruff and dainty cuffs are made. The little right hand
rests lovingly on the head of a King Charles spaniel, whose
neck is adorned with bells. An old rose curtain gives a
charming note of color to the background.</p>

<p><b>Moreelse's Great Success as a Portrait-painter.</b>&mdash;Paulus
Moreelse (1571-1638), a native of Utrecht and a pupil and
follower of Mierevelt in Delft, became so successful as a
portrait-painter that all the great ladies desired to sit to
him. He visited Rome in 1604, and on his return painted
for a time historical and architectural subjects. He was
also a capable engraver and architect.</p>

<p><b>Other Portraits by Moreelse.</b>&mdash;In addition to The Little
Princess, we may see in this gallery a very fine portrait of
Maria van Utrecht, wife of Joan van Oldenbarnevelt, at the
age of sixty-three (1615); also a Portrait of Himself; one
of A Woman; another of Frederick V., King of Bohemia;
another of Colonel Wtenhoghe; and The Beautiful Shepherdess,
dated 1630, with flowers and a veil on her head,
yellow draperies, and a rake in her hand. This picture
was purchased for 2,150 florins in 1817. In all probability
it is a portrait.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Mierevelt, a Popular Portrait-painter.</b>&mdash;Michael Mierevelt
(1567-1641), the son of a goldsmith and pupil of Anthony
van Montfoort at Utrecht, attained notoriety by his
portraits of some of the princes of the House of Nassau.
From that time he was never without orders; and he is
supposed to have painted a greater number of portraits
than any other artist of his country. Mierevelt spent most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of his life in Delft. The Rijks contains a great number of
his works, among which are: portraits of Jacob Cats; Johan
v. Oldenbarnevelt; F. Hendrik; Philips Willem, Prince of
Orange; Prince Maurits; Johannes Uitenbogaert; Frederick
V., Elector of the Palatinate; Lubbert Gerritz; Paulus
van Beresteyn; Volckera Nicolai; Henrick Hooft, and of
Aegje Hasselaer, wife of Henrick Hooft.</p>

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Portaits'">Portraits</ins> by Honthorst.</b>&mdash;The student of history and
lover of portraits will be attracted by the following
Honthorsts: Frederick Wilhelm, Elector of Brandenburg,
and his wife, Louise Henriette of Orange; William II.,
Prince of Orange; William II. with his wife, Princess Maria
Stuart of England; <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Frederik Hendrik' and 'Frederick Henry' (or vice versa) were used in this text. This was retained.">Frederik Hendrik</ins>; Amalia v. Solms;
and the Princes of Orange, William I., Maurits, Frederik Hendrik,
William II., and William III.</p>

<p><b>Portraits by Van der Helst.</b>&mdash;By Van der Helst there
are portraits of Maria Stuart, Princess Royal of England,
widow of William II., Prince of Orange; Portrait of a
Warrior; and Portraits of Andries Bicker, Burgomaster
of Amsterdam (1586-1652); and Gerard A. Bicker
(1623-66).</p>

<p><b>Rubens's Portrait of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Helena Fourment' and 'Eleanor Forman' were used in this text. This was retained.">Helena Fourment</ins>.</b>&mdash;Rubens's portrait
of Helena Fourment shows his second wife, in a different
mood and costume from the one in the Mauritshuis.
Here she is represented full face, with hair curled in tufts,
a satin bodice, high fan-shaped ruff spreading behind the
head, throat half bare, with necklace and many jewels.
He has also a portrait of Anna Maria, wife of Louis XIII.
of France.</p>

<p><b>Portraits by Van Dijck.</b>&mdash;Van Dijck is represented by
a Portrait of William II., Prince of Orange, and his Betrothed,
Mary Stuart, painted in 1641; a Portrait of a Man;
and one of Johannes Baptist Franck, a young man of twenty-eight,
with light hair, pointed beard, and moustache, and
wearing a black cloak draped in graceful folds. This was
once in Lucien Bonaparte's collection.</p>

<p><b>Portraits by T. de Keijser.</b>&mdash;A few examples of Theodor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
de Keijser, though of small dimensions, rank among the best
specimens of this painter.</p>

<p><b>Change of Fashion in Portrait-painting exemplified by
Maes.</b>&mdash;Maes, more familiar by his <i>genre</i>, has no less than
eight portraits here, besides a large corporation picture
representing the Chiefs of the Corporation of Surgeons of
Amsterdam, 1680-81. The great difference in style and
quality between the early and late portraits of this master
has led many to believe that they are the work of more
than one master. The change is attributed to his visit to
Antwerp; but it has been pointed out that the fashion was
changing everywhere, including Amsterdam, where even
Rembrandt during the closing years of his life was despised
and neglected by the fashionable public. Maes, on the
other hand, made concessions to the vulgar taste; and, for
a quarter of a century, produced an enormous quantity of
secondary or mediocre portraits, in which all trace of his
master's qualities was lost.</p>

<p><b>Artists' Portraits of Themselves.</b>&mdash;Though not so great
in the line of painters' portraits of themselves as the Uffizi,
the Rijks possesses a good number of men who thought
they saw themselves as others saw them, or at any rate, as
they wished posterity to know them. Among these are
Jan Steen, Gerrit Dou, Ferdinand Bol, Honthorst, Ter
Borch, and L. Bakhuysen.</p>

<p>A fine portrait by Bol of the famous sculptor Artus
Quellin; a Male Portrait by Dou; one of Amalia v. Solms
by Flinck; and the Portrait of an Architect with his Wife
and Child, by Bernhart Fabritius, deserve notice.</p>

<p><b>Van der Helst, a Great Portrait-painter.</b>&mdash;Bartholomew
van der Helst (1613-70) was considered the greatest
portrait-painter of his time, and received more money for
his portraits than any other Dutch painter; yet, notwithstanding
his industry and the money that he received, he
died poor. He is thought to have been a pupil of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Nicholas Eliasz' and 'Nicolaes Elias' were used in this text. This was retained.">Nicholas Eliasz</ins>
Pickenoy at Amsterdam, where he fell under the
influence of Rembrandt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Description of The Civic Guard Banquet.</b>&mdash;Bartholomew
van der Helst's great work, The Schuttersmaaltijd
(Civic Guard Banquet), held June 18, 1648, in the upper
hall of the Cross-bow, or St. George Company House, at
the Singel, in celebration of the Peace of M&uuml;nster, always
fascinates.</p>

<p>The twenty-five figures are all portraits. At the head of
the table Captain Wits is seated in a chair of black oak
with a velvet cushion. He is dressed in black velvet, his
breast covered with a cuirass, and on his head is a broad-brimmed
black hat with white plumes. His left hand,
supported on his knee, holds a magnificent silver drinking-horn
ornamented with a St. George and the Dragon,&mdash;which
valuable piece of silver, by the way, is on permanent
exhibition with other beakers and drinking-horns of the old
guilds in the Rijks. The good-humored Captain is cordially
grasping the hand of Lieutenant Van Waveren, who wears
a handsome pearl-gray doublet richly brocaded with gold,
and lace collar and cuffs. His feet are crossed, and he
wears boots of yellow leather with large tops and gold spurs.
His hat is black, with dark brown plumes. Behind him,
in the centre of the picture, is the standard-bearer, Jacob
Banning, in easy, martial attitude, hat in hand, his right
hand on his chair, his right leg on his left knee. He holds
the flag of blue silk, on which the Virgin is embroidered.
The banner covers his shoulder, and he looks out toward
the spectator frankly and complacently. The man behind
him is probably a sergeant. He wears a cuirass, yellow
gloves, gray stockings, and boots with large tops and kneecaps
of cloth. On his knee is a napkin, and in his hands
a piece of ham, a slice of bread, and a knife. The old man
behind him is thought to be William the Drummer. In one
hand he holds his hat, and in the other a gold-footed wineglass
filled with the most marvellously painted white wine.
He wears a black satin doublet slashed with yellow silk, and
a red sash. Behind him are two matchlock men seated at
the end of a table. One, with a napkin on his knee, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
eating with his knife; the other holds a long glass of white
wine, also a marvel of the painter's skill. Four musketeers,
with differently shaped hats, stand behind; one holds a glass,
the others have their guns on their shoulders. Between the
standard-bearer and the Captain several guests are placed:
one is carving a fowl; another, with his hat off and hand
uplifted, is talking to his neighbor; a third is filling a cup
from a silver flagon; and a fourth holds a silver plate.
Behind the Captain are two other figures, one of whom is
peeling an orange. Two others with <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'halberds' and 'halberts' were used in this text. This was retained.">halberts</ins> are standing,
and one holds a plumed hat. Between Banning and the
Captain there are three others, one of whom holds a pewter
pot, engraved with the name Pocock, the landlord of the
Hotel Doele. At the back a maidservant is bringing in a
pasty on which rests a turkey. The <i>fa&ccedil;ades</i> of two houses
are seen through the panes of the window in the background.
In the left-hand corner stands a very handsome
wine-cooler.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Reynolds's Opinion of this Picture.</b>&mdash;"The best picture in
this house is painted by Van der Helst. It represents a company
of trained bands, about thirty figures, whole-length, among
which the Spanish Ambassador is introduced shaking hands
with one of the principal figures. This is perhaps the first
picture of portraits in the world, comprehending more of those
qualities which make a perfect portrait than any other I have
ever seen: they are correctly drawn, both head and figures, and
well colored; and have great variety of action, characters, and
countenances, and those so lively and truly expressing what
they are about, that the spectator has nothing to wish for. Of
this picture I had before heard great commendations; but it
far exceeded my expectations." ...</p>

<p><b>A Portrait Group by Rembrandt, and another by Van
der Helst.</b>&mdash;"A Frieze over one of the doors in chiaroscuro
by De Witt, is not only one of the best deceptions I have seen,
but the boys are well drawn; the ceiling and side of the room
are likewise by him, but a poor performance. The academy of
painting is a part of this immense building: in it are two
admirable pictures, composed entirely of portraits,&mdash;one by
Rembrandt, and the other by Bartholomew van der Helst.
That of Rembrandt contains six men dressed in black; one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
them, who has a book before him, appears to have been reading
a lecture; the top of the table not seen. The heads are
finely painted, but not superior to those of his neighbor. The
subject of Van der Helst is the Society of Archers bestowing a
premium: they appear to be investing some person with an
order. The date on this is 1657; on the Rembrandt 1661."</p></div>

<p><b>Van der Helst's Masterpiece.</b>&mdash;Captain Roelof Bicker's
Company, painted in 1639, has been termed Van der
Helst's masterpiece. It is the largest picture of its class
in the gallery and contains thirty-two figures. Captain
Bicker and Lieutenant Jan Blaeu have brought their men
from their headquarters, and are welcoming a new ensign
before the Brewery de Haen (the Cock) on the corner of
the Lastaadje (Geldersche Kade and Bloomsloot), in 1639.
The picture is remarkable for its wonderful display of color
and the vitality that every figure possesses.</p>

<p><b>Regent, Doelen, and Corporation Pictures.</b>&mdash;In every
gallery in Holland the traveller will come across the life-size
groups known as "Regent," "Doelen," and "Corporation"
pictures. These are always portraits of members
of shooting, charitable, and medical civic societies and
guilds of merchants, and were painted at the order of these
various companies to hang in their guild halls, shooting
galleries (<i>doelen</i>), and hospitals. Rembrandt, Frans Hals,
and Bartholomew van der Helst brought these pictures to
their highest expression and made of them artistic compositions.
Hals's great works of this class are in Haarlem; but
the Rijks owns, as we have seen, the celebrated Night Watch
and The Syndics, and B. Van der Helst's masterpieces,
Schuttersmaaltijd and Company of Captain Roelof Bicker.</p>

<p><b>Similar Pictures by Govert Flinck.</b>&mdash;Next in importance
are the works of Govert Flinck (1615-60), a pupil
and close imitator of Rembrandt, who devoted his energies
to portraits and historical and religious subjects. Three
"Corporation" or "Doelen" pictures by his hand hang in
this gallery; also Isaac Blessing Jacob, dated 1638; and
three portraits, including one of J. van den Vondel, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
thought so highly of Flinck that he compared him to the
Greek Apelles.</p>

<p><b>His Greatest Work.</b>&mdash;His most important "Corporation"
picture depicts the same scene as Van der Helst's.
This, called Arquebusiers of Amsterdam at a Banquet Celebrating
the Signing of the Peace of M&uuml;nster in 1648, is
considered this artist's greatest work; it is particularly interesting
from the fact that it contains a portrait of the
painter himself standing in the doorway. This picture is in
two groups: on the left, nine men are coming from the St.
Jorisdoele, led by Captain Jan Huidecoper van Maarseveen,
dressed in black velvet, with a blue sash; and the other
group, consisting of eleven figures, is led by Lieutenant
Frans van Waveren, also dressed in black velvet with a
blue sash, who is congratulating the Captain.</p>

<p>The two other "Regent" pictures are: Four Chief
Masters of the Arquebusiers' Shooting Company and The
Company of Captain Bas and Lieutenant Conyn.</p>

<p><b>Bol's Pictures of this Class.</b>&mdash;Burger, however, when
looking at Ferdinand Bol's pictures of this class in the
Rijks, especially The Regents of the Leprozenhuis in Amsterdam,
and its companion The Lady Patronesses of the
Leprozenhuis, placed the artist second to none but Rembrandt,
and even the superior of B. van der Helst.</p>

<p><b>Description of the First of These.</b>&mdash;The first picture
(8 by 6 feet) represents the Regents of the establishment,
among whom are the Burgomaster Hofdt and the Receiver
of Amsterdam, Pieter van Uitenbogaard, Rembrandt's
friend. All are dressed in black, with large hats, and are
seated around a table covered with a Persian carpet. The
<i>custos</i> is bringing before them a little <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'bare-headed' and 'bareheaded' were used in this text. This was retained.">bare-headed</ins> leper.
The figures are life-size, and "have the distinction of Van
Dijck's personages," writes Burger, "and the solidity and
depth of Rembrandt's."</p>

<p><b>Dujardin's Regents of the House of Correction.</b>&mdash;Karel
Dujardin's Regents of the House of Correction in Amsterdam,
painted in 1669, is another remarkable work and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
unusual in style for this artist. The canvas is no less than
12 feet 8 inches by 7 feet 8 inches, and represents the five
Regents. Of natural size, these are grouped around a table
with a violet velvet cover. (Violet, it may be noted, was
Karel Dujardin's favorite color.) One of the Regents, his
body turned to the left and his head three-quarters, is
seated in front, with his right hand on the table; he holds
a paper with a coat-of-arms dated February, 1669, and
signed "Medelman"; his left hand rests on his hip. Another
holds out his hand to a servant, who is bringing him
a paper. One only is standing. All are dressed in black,
with large black hats and white neckbands. Some white
marble columns in the style of G. de Lairesse are seen in
the background, where a servant with her hands crossed
over her waist is entering the open door and turning her
head to listen to a young man. Heads, hands, faces, and
costumes are all remarkably depicted.</p>

<p><b>Other Pictures of the Same Class.</b>&mdash;Before dismissing
the Corporation pictures we may mention J. van Sandrart's
Captain van Swieten's Company Preparing to Escort Queen
Dowager Marie de M&eacute;dici, painted in 1638, and considered
the artist's chief work; P. Moreelse's Amsterdam
Arquebusiers; N. Elias's Banquet of Captain J. Backer's
Company; B. van der Helst's Presidents of the Voetboog-doelen
and Presidents of the Handboog-doelen.</p>

<p>One of the earliest pictures of this class is Cornelis
Teunissen's Banquet of the Civic Guards of the Cross-bow
Company, painted in Amsterdam in 1533. Another by the
same artist, Guards of the Cloveniers-doelen, was painted
in 1557. A still earlier one, Dirck Jacobsz's Civic Guards
of the Cloveniers-doelen, was painted in 1529. This
artist is also represented by Civic Guards of the Arquebusiers,
which hangs near Dirck Barentsz's Civic Guards
and Civic Guards of the Cross-bow Company. A number
of Regent pictures also hang in the Hall of Anatomy
Pictures, including Lessons in Anatomy, by Thomas de
Keijser, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Nicholas Eliasz' and 'Nicolaes Elias' were used in this text. This was retained.">Nicolaes Elias</ins>, Dr. J. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Deyman,' 'Deyment,' and 'Deeman' were used in this text.

(the latter a fragment). It is unlikely, however, that the
visitor will care to linger in this lugubrious hall.</p>

<p><b>The Portrait Hall.</b>&mdash;We now pass into the Portrait Hall,
which contains two portrait collections, consisting of portraits
bequeathed by the Bicker family of Amsterdam, and
twenty-six pictures purchased in 1895 from the descendants
of the great Admiral de Ruyter. Here we again find a
number of Corporation and Regent pictures, chief among
which is Rembrandt's Syndics of the Guild of Clothmakers,
which has been described.</p>

<p><b>Abundance of Dutch Landscapes in the Rijks.</b>&mdash;The
Rijks is rich in landscapes of every period of Dutch art.
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins> is particularly well represented. His pictures are
The Torrent, Ch&acirc;teau de Bentheim, Winter, The Forest,
View of Haarlem, Landscape, Wooded Landscape, Landscape
in Norway, and View of the Rhine near Wijk bij
Duurstede.</p>

<p><b>Description of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>'s View of the Rhine near
Duurstede.</b>&mdash;Burger thought that the picture of the banks
of the Rhine taken from Wijk near Duurstede deserved to
be placed by the side of the superb Tempest in the
Louvre; for it has "the same original grandeur of execution
and the same depth of sentiment." This is almost a
marine. The water occupies almost all the left foreground,
where you note a sail-boat. A large boat, the masts of
which you see only, has taken refuge in the little bay in the
centre. On the right, upon a tongue of land that juts out
and is bordered by piles, stands a windmill; behind this is
a house, and on the horizon a steeple. A little to the left
of the mill and far distant is a castle with turrets. On the
road that leads to the mill come three peasant women in
white aprons. One wears a white head-dress; the two
others have yellow ones. You can also distinguish some
other tiny figures by the little bay where the boat lies. The
incomparable sky is gray, and the clouds are of the same
hue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Burger on the Same Picture.</b>&mdash;"Earth, water, sky, all
are so beautifully combined in a harmony so strong and dominating,
so simple and magnificent, that you are impressed with
that strange&mdash;almost terrible&mdash;effect produced, and you can't
tell why. Indeed, there is only a large mill with a round,
tower-like base in the ordinary fashion of the country, and three
women who are returning to the village. There is nothing to
excite the imagination. Yet, notwithstanding, you are filled
with an irresistible melancholy. The character and nature of
the people are so strongly marked that you are taken out of
yourself and transported by the force of the artist's heart and
creation."</p></div>

<p>Another picture represents a mill with its wheel in the
water; and on the right some wood-cutters at work. This
is a strong picture, but a little sombre.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Burger on The Cascade.</b>&mdash;"The Cascade [6 feet long by 4
feet high] seems to have been composed with various elements
of Nature herself. The water bounds and foams in the
foreground and over the entire canvas. Above this great torrent
on the right are tall trees, beneath which are four little
figures; and on the left, a clump of shrubs, in the shadows of
which a flock of sheep is passing by the brook. In the background,
behind the meadows, a belfry is seen on the horizon.
It is very rich, very vigorous, very beautiful."</p></div>

<p><b>Influence of Everdingen.</b>&mdash;The Norwegian Landscape
(about five feet long) is also a large picture. Here the cascade
tumbles over little rocks, and on the right are rocks,
trees, a house, and one tall, isolated tree. This is cleverly
painted, but the composition is not happy. The true accents
of nature are lacking; for it is certain that <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>
never was in Norway, and that he devoted himself to cascades
and rocks on account of his intimacy with Van Everdingen,
whose bold landscapes, so different from Holland,
surprised and delighted the Dutch. Everdingen had suffered
shipwreck in Norway, and had been greatly taken
with its bold, savage scenery. His favorite subject was a
waterfall in a glen with sombre fringes of pines mingled
with birch, and log huts at the base of rocks and craggy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
slopes. The prevalence of falling water in his pictures,
when others could paint only the monotonous Dutch lowlands,
gained for him the name "Inventor of Cascades."</p>

<p>Salomon <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins> (?-1670) has two fine landscapes, The
Halt, dated 1660, and The Village Inn, dated 1655.</p>

<p><b>Description of Hobbema's <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'water-mill' and 'water mill' were used in this text. This was retained.">Water Mill</ins>.</b>&mdash;Hobbema is
represented by two Water Mills and a Landscape. The
picture in the Van der Hoop Collection shows a wooden
mill with red-tiled roof in the centre of the picture; and
behind it a background of tall trees. Hollowed-out-tree-trunks
supported by boards carry the water to the mill
wheel, over which it falls. The foreground is occupied
with water in which ducks are swimming. In the shadows
of the door of the house, a tiny figure of a man appears;
and a small figure of a woman in bright red bodice, upon
which the sunlight falls, is busy washing clothes in a copper.
On the right, an old peasant in brown is holding by
the hand a little boy who wears a red cap. The Landscape
is diversified with trees and thickets. The sky is full of
clouds, between which the rays of sunlight issue to gild the
verdure. Delicate tones of olive and gray distinguish this
beautiful picture.</p>

which by some is thought superior to the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'water-mill' and 'water mill' were used in this text. This was retained.">Water Mill</ins>, a house and barn are seen on the right; two small
figures are in front of the house, a man in black, standing,
and a woman in red, bending over; and there are a group
of trees, a large elm, and a hedge. All this is beautifully
reflected in a sheet of water in the foreground,&mdash;a reflection
that seems to tremble. This picture is only one foot
five inches long by one foot high.</p>

<p><b>Hobbema and his most Frequent Scenes.</b>&mdash;Meyndert
Hobbema (1638-1709), supposed to have been a pupil of
Jacob <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>, or of Jacob's brother Salomon, was long
neglected, and died in penury. He is now regarded
second to none but Ruisdael and his works are worth
their weight in gold. His most frequent scenes are villages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
surrounded by trees, such as are frequently met with in
Guelderland, with winding pathways leading from house to
house. A <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'water-mill' and 'water mill' were used in this text. This was retained.">water mill</ins> occasionally forms a prominent feature,&mdash;so
prominent, indeed, as to give its name to the
picture. Again, he paints a slightly uneven country diversified
by trees in groups or rows, wheat fields, meadows,
and small pools; occasionally a view of a town with gates,
or canals with sluices and quays; and more rarely the ruins
of an old castle or a stately residence in the far distance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Hobbema, a Master of the Still Life of Woods and
Waters.</b>&mdash;"It is doubtful whether any one ever mastered so
completely as he did the still life of woods and hedges, or mills
and pools. Nor can we believe that he obtained this mastery
otherwise than by constantly dwelling in the same neighborhood,
say in Guelders or on the Dutch Westphalian border, where
day after day he might study the branching and foliage of trees
and underwood embowering cottages and mills, under every
variety of light, in every shade of transparency, in all changes
produced by the season. Though his landscapes are severely
and moderately toned, generally in an olive key, and often attuned
to a puritanical gray or russet, they surprise us, not only
by the variety of their leafage, but by the finish of their detail
as well as the boldness of their touch. With astonishing subtlety
light is shown penetrating cloud, and illuminating&mdash;sometimes
transiently, sometimes steadily&mdash;different portions of the
ground, shining through leaves upon other leaves, and multiplying
in an endless way the transparency of the picture. If the
chance be given him he mirrors all these things in the still pool
near a cottage, the reaches of a sluggish river, or the swirl of a
stream that feeds a busy mill. The same spot will furnish him
with several pictures. One mill gives him repeated opportunity
of charming our eye. And this wonderful artist, who is only
second to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins> because he had not Ruisdael's versatility
and did not extend his study equally to downs and rocky eminences
or torrents and estuaries,&mdash;this is the man who lived
penuriously, died poor, and left no trace in the artistic annals of
his country. It has been said that Hobbema did not paint his
own figures, but transferred that duty to Adriaen <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>,

<p><b>Hackaert's Pictures.</b>&mdash;Jan Hackaert is perfect when he
is simple and inspired by the character and style of his own
country. The Rijks owns his beautiful Avenue of Ash-trees;
a Clearing in the Forest; a Landscape with Cattle;
and a Landscape, which is full of light and delicacy, and
recalls the manner of Wijnants, although the arrangement
follows the pseudo-Italians.</p>

<p><b>Hackaert's Avenue of Ash-trees.</b>&mdash;The Avenue of
Ash-trees is a charming picture, representing a park from
which a hunting-party is about to set forth in the early
morning. The light shines on the trunks of the trees that
border the park, to the right of which is a large sheet of
water. Huntsmen accompanied by dogs, one of which is
barking at two swans in the pool, ladies and gentlemen on
horseback, servants, and dogs, all issue forth with good
wishes from the master of the <i>ch&acirc;teau</i> at the gate. All of
these elegantly painted little figures are the work of A.

<p><b>Joos van Winghen.</b>&mdash;Joos van Winghen (1544-1603)
travelled to Rome, where he lived for four years; and, on
his return, was appointed Court Painter to the Prince of
Parma. He painted portraits, interiors, and Biblical subjects.
A Banquet and Masquerade at Night is one of his
best-known pictures.</p>

<p><b>Pieter Aertsen.</b>&mdash;This artist has a picture called The
Egg Dance, which claims attention by its life and spirit.</p>

<p><b>Jan Lijs.</b>&mdash;Jan Lijs (d. 1629) was a pupil of Goltzius;
and then visited France and Italy, where he executed large
works under Caravaggio's influence. His Music Party is
signed and dated 1625; and therefore belongs to his last
and not his first period, as the catalogue informs us.</p>

<p><b>Pieter van Rijck.</b>&mdash;Pieter Cornelisz van Rijck (1568-1628)
painted interiors, especially kitchens, and landscape.
He was a pupil of H. Jacobs Grimani, whom he accompanied
to Italy; he remained there fifteen years. The big
picture in the Rijks representing a kitchen interior was
described in enthusiastic terms by Van Mander.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Willem Duyster.</b>&mdash;Willem Cornelisz Duyster (1599-1635)
was a pupil of Pieter Codde. His picture of Backgammon
Players is matched by a similar subject in St.
Petersburg, and another in Dresden. Another picture in
the Rijks, variously attributed to J. v. Bijlert, Jan Lijs, P.
Codde, Jan Miense Molenaer and others, has by recent
discoveries been finally recognized as the work of Duyster.
The subject is The Marriage of Adriaen Ploos van Amstel,
Lord of Oudegein and Tienhoven, to Agnes van Bijler,
widow Broekhuysen. A contemporary of whom little is
known, Abraham van der Hecken (fl. 1650), has a Butcher's
Shop, painted with much truth and spirit.</p>

<p><b>Pieter de Bloot.</b>&mdash;Pieter de Bloot (1600-52) was a
pupil of Jordaens; he painted, however, more closely after
Teniers, with fine grasp of chiaroscuro and perspective,
with a soft and agreeable coloring. He copied nature so
faithfully as to reproduce his subjects in all their ignobleness.
<i>Kermesses</i> and interiors chiefly occupied his brush.
The Lawyer's Office is signed and dated 1628; it is a fine
specimen of the work of this artist in his prime.</p>

<p><b>Van Gaesbeeck and Van der Kuyl.</b>&mdash;Adriaen van
Gaesbeeck (?-1650), of the same period, was probably one
of G. Dou's pupils. He painted <i>genre</i> pictures of small
dimensions. His Young Man in a Study is full of the feeling
found in his master's work. Another painter of <i>genre</i>,
who is represented here by two charming pictures, is Gysbert
van der Kuyl (?-1673). He was a pupil of the
famous Wouter Crabeth the Younger, and like his early
master, spent many years in France and Italy. Later in
life he modelled himself on Honthorst and Abraham Bloemaert.
His Ruse Surpasses Force and The Music Party
are worth more than a passing glance.</p>

<p><b>Nicolas <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Moeyaert' and 'Moijaert' were used in this text. This was retained.">Moeyaert</ins>.</b>&mdash;Nicolas Cornelisz Moeyaert was a
forerunner of Rembrandt in his treatment of light and
shade. His powers of portraiture are exemplified here in a
group of Regents; and another side of his art is charmingly
displayed in the Choice of a Lover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Jan van Bijlert.</b>&mdash;Jan van Bijlert (1603-71) was a
painter of <i>genre</i>, mythological, and historical subjects.
Almost all his known pictures were ordered by foreign
rulers. The Guitar Player is a small example of his work,
for he usually painted his figures life-size. His style so
much resembles that of G. Honthorst that his pictures have
frequently been confounded with those of the latter.</p>

<p><b>Adriaen Brouwer.</b>&mdash;Adriaen Brouwer studied with
Adriaen van Ostade and under Hals; and afterwards adopted
the Flemish style when he returned to Antwerp in 1631.
However, he remained true to one ideal,&mdash;the striving
after true action and physiognomy, and the feeling for
character and expression. No finer examples of his
powers in this field exist than The Village Orgy and The
Peasant Combat. These both belong to the days when
he was under the influence of Hals.</p>

<p><b>Cornelis Saftleven.</b>&mdash;Cornelis Saftleven (1606-81) also
took Brouwer as his model, for his usual types and favorite
motives are borrowed from that master. Like Brouwer,
he painted tavern interiors with men sitting at table before
a pot of beer and a game of cards. Sometimes he mixes
with his jovial companions a peasant who seems to have
escaped from one of Teniers's <i>kermesses</i>; and sometimes
he makes an excursion into the simple representation of
rustic scenes. He is full of spirit, and groups his little
characters with fine art. His compositions are full of life
and movement, but his color is tame and lacks brilliance.
His three pictures here are Peasants at an Inn (1642);
Landscape with Peasants and Cattle (1652); and Peasants
Praying: an Approaching Storm.</p>

<p><b>Jan Olis.</b>&mdash;Jan Olis (1610-70) was a painter of <i>genre</i>
and landscape. An interesting picture of a kitchen here
is signed and dated 1645. Until recently, however, this
picture was attributed to Sorgh.</p>

<p><b>Van der Oudenrogge.</b>&mdash;Johannes van Oudenrogge
(1622-53) also was a painter of this class. His picture
of Peasants in a Weaving Factory is dated 1652.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Egbert van der Poel.</b>&mdash;Egbert van der Poel (1621-64)
was a prolific and versatile painter of the school of
Isaac <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins> and A. van der Neer. He painted
pictures of all kinds,&mdash;portraits, still life, figures, landscapes,
perspective, kitchen interiors, moonlit landscapes,
and more particularly devoted his talents to conflagrations
at night, in which he was very successful. Nothing could
be more natural and animated than the large number of
tiny figures he shows occupied in extinguishing the flames.
His color is clear and strong. In his Ruins in the Town of
Delft after the Explosion of the Powder Magazine, October
12, 1654, we have a good example of his style. He has
also another picture of the Interior of a Farm, dated 1646.</p>

<p><b>Pieter J. Quast.</b>&mdash;Pieter Jansz Quast (1606-47) was
a follower in the steps of Adriaen Brouwer. His selection
of subjects often verges on caricature. His characterization
is well displayed in The Card Players. The figure of
the young woman in this picture, however, has been entirely
repainted by another hand.</p>

<p><b>Thomas <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Wijck,' 'Wyck,' and 'Wijk' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wijck</ins>'s Versatility.</b>&mdash;Thomas Wijck (1616-77)
was another artist who visited Italy and painted its
landscapes, especially coast scenery, after having been
taught, or at least influenced, by P. de Laer. Besides
marines, he painted interiors, fairs, etc. He had the
talent to depict sea-gates full of movement, figures and
merchandise, in the taste of J. B. Weenix, markets, outlandish
charlatans, public squares, hunts, ruins, tavern
scenes, and everything that the Italians call <i>capricci</i>.</p>

<p><b>Chemical Laboratories his Forte.</b>&mdash;But the subject
that he treated with the greatest care and taste, and with
which he was most happily successful, was that of chemical
laboratories. These he arranges, illuminates, and paints
in a style entirely his own. Without endowing them with
the magic of A. van Ostade, or enveloping them in that
master's full and warm atmosphere, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Wijck,' 'Wyck,' and 'Wijk' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wijck</ins> gave much
charm to his alchemistic interiors, and the objects he multiplied
therein are full of the right kind of feeling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p><b>His Picture of The Alchemist.</b>&mdash;Moreover, he has a
sound comprehension of chiaroscuro, as may be seen here
in his picture The Alchemist. He casts a shadow over the
skeleton fish and stuffed crocodiles and other monstrous
animals hanging from the ceiling. The principal light
usually falls full upon a medley of phials, retorts, furnaces,
bellows, and alembics&mdash;a whole apparatus of strange utensils
that in a subject of this kind could not be regarded
as mere accessories, and which are touched with spirit
but also with sobriety. A second window at the end of
the apartment admits a softer light that forms an echo
to the principal one, and faintly illumines other objects
that are toned down by the intervening atmosphere.
Placed in the centre of his laboratory, wearing a red cap,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Wijck,' 'Wyck,' and 'Wijk' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wijck</ins>'s alchemist is quite individual in not being old, bald,
bent, or grizzled; on the contrary, here is a man in the
prime of life and full of health, with a bright eye and an
open countenance that has no such melancholy in it as
is generally affected by alchemists. It is therefore reasonable
to conclude that Wijck has represented himself in the
person of this seeker after gold.</p>

<p>The Rustic Interior depicts a woman spinning, with a
child and a dog near her.</p>

<p><b>Karel Slabbaert.</b>&mdash;Karel Slabbaert (1619-54), whose
Grace before Meat is in this gallery, is supposed to have
been one of G. Dou's pupils. His pictures are scarce.
This one shows a woman cutting bread, while two children
are saying grace. He paints in warm tones; his composition
is good and full of feeling.</p>

<p><b>Jan Wolfert.</b>&mdash;Jan Baptist Wolfert (1625-87) also
travelled in Italy, and was famous for his classical landscapes
with animals and human figures; he also painted
<i>genre</i>. He was very learned; and his works show fine
spirit and imagination. The Bagpipe Player is dated
1646, and is therefore an early work of this artist before
he was subjected to foreign influence.</p>

<p><b>Caspar Netscher.</b>&mdash;Besides three portraits of brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
quality, Caspar Netscher has a beautiful little interior
called Maternal Care, in which the influence of his master,
Ter Borch, is noticeable. This picture of a mother arranging
her child's hair is generally considered this artist's
masterpiece. There is some story told with each of his
portraits. He marvellously rendered the texture of stuffs;
and his drawing is always full of grace and truth. Inferior
to Ter Borch in harmony and chiaroscuro and to Metsu
in touch, and to both in feeling for color, he equals them
in the tasteful composition and the elegance of his figures,
and surpasses them in beauty of form.</p>

<p><b>Esaias Bourse.</b>&mdash;Esaias Bourse (1630-?) was a follower
of Rembrandt. He had a roving career, making many
voyages to the East Indies during sixteen years as an officer,
and then working as a painter in Italy. His color is usually
brownish in tone. His pictures have sometimes been
confused with those of another of Rembrandt's pupils&mdash;Pieter
de Hooch. An Interior with a Woman Spinning
enables us to compare the merits of the two artists.</p>

<p><b>Daniel Boone.</b>&mdash;Daniel Boone (1631-98) painted mythological
subjects and familiar scenes of peasant life. In
the latter, his chief aim was to provoke laughter by the
representation of grotesque situations and grimaces. In
this he was generally successful. Peasants Playing Cards is
painted in this vein.</p>

<p><b>Pictures by Maes.</b>&mdash;Nicholas Maes is represented in
the Dupper Collection by The Spinner. The old woman
is seated before her wheel in a simply furnished room,
which is dimly lighted from a window on the left. Through
this the fading daylight falls, illuminating the rich red of
her costume and the dull colors of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'table-cloth' and 'tablecloth' were used in this text. This was retained.">table-cloth</ins>. There
is something inexpressibly still, solemn, and charming
about the figure, the room, and the light.</p>

</div>

<p>Another Spinner, in the Van der Hoop Collection, is
seated by her wheel. She wears a black cap, and the
sleeves of her dress are red. She stands out boldly from
the brightly lighted wall. The lights and the figure are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
heavily impasted. The forehead of the old woman is in
sunlight, the rest of the face is in shadow.</p>

<p>A very pleasing picture of his earlier period is The
Dreamer, sometimes called Musing, representing a young
woman who is looking out of a window. From her glance
we gather that she has spied her lover, who is looking up
to her casement, so gracefully decorated with apricots and
peaches.</p>

<p><b>L. de Moni, an Imitator of Dou.</b>&mdash;Louis de Moni
(1698-1771) was a pupil of F. van Kessel and K. E. Biset
at Breda, and later (1721-25) of Philip van Dijk at The
Hague. Blanc says that this mediocre painter endeavored
to resuscitate the long-extinct style of G. Dou and the
elder Mieris, and to constitute himself their posthumous
disciple. In this he only partially succeeded, but at least
he exhibited, along with a certain delicacy of touch, great
care and patience. More than once he borrowed a subject
from Dou&mdash;familiar scenes, and small pictures of one or
two figures. He is good in detail but poor in color. The
Rijks has a small and pleasing picture of his called The
Gardener.</p>

<p><b>J. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Quinkhard' and 'Quinckhard' were used in this text. This was retained.">Quinckhard</ins>.</b>&mdash;Julius Quinckhard (1736-76) was a
pupil of his father, Jan Maurits, but soon abandoned art
for commerce. He was an able painter of portraits and
<i>genre</i> nevertheless, as his Amateurs of Music (dated 1755)
and Amateurs of Art (1757) attest. The figures in the
latter are portraits of the painter and his friend, M. J. C.
Ploos van Amstel.</p>

<p><b>Eight Pictures by Paul Potter in the Rijks.</b>&mdash;Although
there is nothing of Paul Potter's in the Rijks to compare
in reputation with The Bull, or in beauty with <i>La Vache
qui se mire</i>, there are no less than eight of his pictures there.
Horses in a Meadow (1649) and Cows in a Meadow (1651),
the latter having a dark sky that proclaims approaching rain,
were acquired with the Van der Hoop Collection. The
Shepherd's Hut, painted in 1645, is only ten inches long
and six high, but is as brilliant in color as a Cuijp. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
composition is simple: a shepherd guarding his cows and
sheep is seated near his lowly dwelling. A Little Dog is
dated 1653, as is also a Landscape with Cattle.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Bear Hunt.</b>&mdash;An extraordinary
picture is The Bear Hunt, eleven feet square. No one
would ever imagine who the painter was if his signature
were not in enormous letters on the trunk of a tree. This
gigantic work was painted two years after The Bull and
represents a gentleman on horseback and one on foot, six
dogs, and two bears. The bloody contest is taking place
in the foreground. This work was repainted during the
first half of the nineteenth century, and only two dogs
remain of the original painting.</p>

<p><b>Crowe's Opinion of Orpheus Charming Animals.</b>&mdash;The
celebrated Orpheus Charming Animals, painted in
1650, is much smaller (3 by 2 feet), and is much admired
by critics. Crowe says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For power and fulness of warm tones this is one of his
most beautiful works. The left is occupied with little hills
crowned with trees; the right shows a forest, and a glimpse of
the sky. In the foreground is a meadow, where we see a camel,
a boar, a cow, a buffalo, an ass, a ram, a goat, a sheep, and a
hare. In the middle distance, at the foot of a hill, sits Orpheus
playing his lyre; behind him is a dog, and in front of him a
crouching lion, an elephant, a horse, a white unicorn, a wolf,
and various other animals. On the right, at the border of the
forest, emerges a deer."</p></div>

<p><b>Description of Shepherds and Flocks.</b>&mdash;Shepherds and
Flocks, painted in the next year (1651), is also a masterpiece,
remarkable for the clearness of its light golden tones,
especially in the sky. It represents a hilly landscape with
a shepherd playing on the bagpipes, a shepherdess singing
to her child, and flocks of sheep, goats, and oxen grouped
variously. By the side of the shepherd is a black dog.
At the Van der Pot sale, in 1808, this picture brought
10,050 florins!</p>

<p><b>Description of A. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>'s The Artist and his
Family.</b>&mdash;A very beautiful work by Adriaen van de Velde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
is The Artist and his Family in the Van der Hoop Collection.
It is generally considered one of the most incomparable
and precious works in the gallery. This is a
landscape bathed in the light of a lovely Autumn evening.
The scene is probably near Haarlem, where the
artist is enjoying the country with his family. Adriaen
himself, about twenty-eight, is standing in the foreground,
dressed very simply but elegantly in brown with a white
collar, his hat under his left arm while his right rests
on his huge and fashionable walking-stick. He has blue
eyes, chestnut hair, a small moustache, a fine mouth, and a
charming expression. On his left stands his wife, whose
handsome figure is dressed in a crimson skirt, brown corsage,
a white fichu, and a black cloak. She wears a little
cap and long, ash-colored gloves. Her hands are crossed
over her waist. Near this attractive couple is a little boy
of seven dressed just like his father, leading a little spaniel
by a string to a fountain. He has thrown his hat on the
ground. A nurse dressed in a blue skirt, white apron, and
yellow bodice is sitting at a little distance on a tree-trunk,
taking care of the little daughter, who is playing with some
flowers. Around them are some bushes and stumps, a kind
of hedge, and an undulating and sandy ground that leads
into a group of trees. On the road, in the middle distance
behind Adriaen, is the carriage that has brought them
here,&mdash;an open four-wheeled chariot, with red seats, drawn
by two fine dappled-gray horses, whose harness a servant in
gray is examining. On the right, a shepherd is lying on
the grass, near a flock of sheep and a goat. In the background
is a meadow with cattle, a winding stream, a house
half hidden in the woods, and the distant line of the horizon.
The landscape has all the delicacy of a Wijnants, but
more breadth and harmony.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Crowe's Opinion of this Picture.</b>&mdash;"This picture, signed
and dated 1667, and of considerable size (4 ft. 8-1/2 in. high by 5
ft. 7 in. wide), is without question the finest work of the master.
The composition of the whole is picturesque in no common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
degree; while the union of a tenderly graduated tone in keeping
with the most delicate carrying out of all the parts shows what
a height of perfection the school had attained at this time."</p></div>

<p>This picture was bought in London in 1833 for 15,700
florins.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Chase.</b>&mdash;The Chase (1669) shows
a beautiful picture with a wooded background. On the
left, through the gate of a park comes a huntsman with the
hounds. A large chestnut palfrey with a green saddle embroidered
with silver is led by a valet in red livery, and a
little farther away a gray horse with trappings of scarlet
velvet is led by another valet. On the right are seated two
men: one in red, the other in brown, and before them a
big fawn and a white dog; another large dog is sniffing the
ground in the foreground on the left.</p>

<p><b>Other Works by A. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>.</b>&mdash;A Landscape with
Cattle shows a somewhat sombre country with clumps of
trees; on the left, sheep, goats, and a little shepherd; in
full light two cows, one white standing in profile, and
the other black, seen from behind and foreshortened. It
brought 5,650 florins in 1838. A Landscape with Ferry
(1666), The Cabin (1671), and another Landscape complete
the list of A. van de Velde's works in the Rijks.</p>

<p><b>An Appreciation of A. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>'s Pictures.</b>&mdash;His
cattle browse in velvet meadows under a beautiful sky.
Animals, meadows, grassy hills, and trees&mdash;he painted
them all with affection. He excels in depicting the various
hides and skins of goats, sheep, horses, and asses. Animals
always occupy a prominent place in Van de Velde's canvases.
The air seems to circulate&mdash;light, pure air gently
moving the trees or slightly waving the grass. The blue
sky is filled with vaporous clouds, which are often mirrored
in tranquil lakes. The chestnut with its thick foliage, the
willow with its flexible branches, the oak, he paints in
masses, or singly, with exquisite skill.</p>

<p><b>General Description of Aelbert Cuijp's Style.</b>&mdash;Aelbert
Cuijp (1620-91), son and pupil of Jacob Cuijp, first followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
his father's style, as is evidenced in the Hilly Landscape in
the Rijks. Little by little he formed his own style and became
thoroughly original. He excelled in depicting the humid
atmosphere about Dordrecht, and on the horizon of all
his landscapes generally the clock-tower of his native city is
represented half veiled in golden mist emerging from the lush
meadows, where placid cows repose in the bright sunshine.</p>

<p><b>His Versatility.</b>&mdash;Though Cuijp loves to paint the calm
meadows of Holland under a golden light, his elegant figures
of men and animals, dashing cavaliers, boats driven by the
approaching storm, and landscapes seen under the enchantment
of moonlight prove how versatile he was. Moreover,
he was a brilliant painter of still life, as the partridges in
The Return from the Chase (in the Louvre), the Salmons
Offered to Mr. de Roovere Directing the Fisheries in Dordrecht
(in The Hague), and the Dead Game (in the Rotterdam
Gallery) show.</p>

<p><b>His Skill in painting Living Birds.</b>&mdash;As for painting
living birds he is only equalled by Melchior d' <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins>.
It is only necessary to look at his magnificent Fight between
a Turkey and a Cock which hangs in the Rijks. The sky
has darkened in sympathy, as it were, with this epic combat,
where two splendid specimens are using their beaks
and claws with the greatest fury, and the brilliant feathers
fly in all directions. Splendid in color, furious of action,
and beautiful in its arrangement of light and shade, it deserves
its great reputation.</p>

<p>The Rijks owns four other pictures: Portrait of a Young
Man, Shepherds with their Flocks, Cattle, and View of
Dordrecht.</p>

<p><b>Description of Shepherds with their Flocks.</b>&mdash;Shepherds
with their Flocks represents an Autumn morning in a
meadow, where four grazing cows and a shepherd on a mule
occupy the foreground; on the left, a man on an ass and
a man on foot wearing a red vest; on the right, two large
trees; in the middle distance, some trees, a river, and a
tower; and in the background, mountains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Description of Cattle.</b>&mdash;This painting represents a great
red ox with a white head, standing in profile on the left,
occupying half the picture; a little behind is seen a black
ox, full face; both stand out from the gray wall of a house.
In front of the red ox three lovely pigeons are pecking.
On the left, in the middle distance, a brown and a dun-colored
ox are lying down. In the background, on the
horizon, are trees and the spires and towers of Dordrecht.
The sky is superb.</p>

<p>The View of Dordrecht seen from a great expanse of
water, marvellously painted, is also a beautiful picture.</p>

<p><b>Jacob G. Cuijp's Sc&egrave;ne Champ&ecirc;tre.</b>&mdash;Jacob <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both Jacob 'Gerritz' and 'Gerritsz' Cuijp were used in this text. This was retained.">Gerritsz</ins>
Cuijp (1594-1651?), father of Aelbert, is a painter whose
pictures are very scarce. His Portrait of a Woman is dated
1651; and a very fine <i>Sc&egrave;ne Champ&ecirc;tre</i>, which brought
no less than 4,000 florins in 1849, represents, according to
Immergeel, the family of the painter Cornelis Troost, a gay
and large family. The grandmother, father, mother, four
boys, and two girls are walking in a landscape where is also
seen a chariot drawn by a handsome black horse of the
Frisian race that Aelbert Cuijp so often paints.</p>

<p><b>The Cuijp Family.</b>&mdash;The founder of this family was
Gerrit Gerritsz Cuijp, originally from Venlo, who settled in
Dordrecht, where in 1585 he entered the Guild of St. Luke
as a painter on glass. He sent his talented son, Jacob, to
study with Abraham Bloemaert. Jacob Cuijp became known
as a portrait-painter, and was noted for his fine drawing,
splendid coloring, and force of expression. His pictures
were ranked with those of Th. de Keijser. He was no less
skilful in painting animals and landscapes and family groups
in the open air, undisturbed by browsing cattle.</p>

<p><b>Benjamin G. Cuijp's Style.</b>&mdash;Benjamin Gerritsz Cuijp
(1612-52), brother of Jacob and uncle of Aelbert, a painter
who has attracted much attention of late years, differed
entirely in taste and style from them both. He was particularly
fond of historical and mythological subjects, and
belonged to the Italian group of Dutch painters, who tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to amalgamate the traditions of classic art with the growing
realism of the day. Some of his works show the influence
of the young Rembrandt. His Joseph Interpreting Dreams
was acquired by the Rijks in 1883.</p>

<p><b>Jan van Goyen.</b>&mdash;Jan van Goyen has five beautiful landscapes:
River Scene, View on the Meuse and Town of
Dordrecht, View of Valkenhof at Nimeguen, View of
Dordrecht, and a Landscape.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Burger's Explanation of the River Scene.</b>&mdash;"The view of
a river in the Van der Hoop Collection is the last expression of
his magnificent and exalted manner. A better name for this picture
would be The Windmill. In a few words here is the picture:
A bit of the Meuse; on the right a piece of ground covered
with trees and houses, and on the summit a black mill with its
sails spread to the winds, extending high upon the canvas; a
stockade, against which the waves of the river break gently, the
water heavy, soft, and admirable; and a little corner of the
almost lost horizon, very attenuated, very firm, very pale, yet
very distinct, on which rises the white sail of a boat, a flat sail
without the slightest wind in the canvas, but having a value
tender and perfectly exquisite. Above, a great sky filled with
clouds; through the rifts and holes the shining blue that they
efface, the clouds all gray and filling the space from the stockade
to the top of the canvas; so that there is no light in any
part of this powerful tonality, composed of dark brown and
sombre slate colors. In the centre of the picture one ray of
light glimmers like a smile upon the clouds. A great square

and my notes add <i>merveilleux dans l'or</i>."</p></div>

<p><b>Karel Dujardin (1625-78).</b>&mdash;Of the Portrait of a Gentleman
with a Dog and a Dead Hare (1670), Burger
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>A Dead Picture of a Dead Hare.</b>&mdash;"The deadest one in the
lot is not the hare; for if the hare were alive the dog certainly
could not run after him, nor could the gentleman run after his
dog. The gentleman is dressed in tin-plate and is represented
to the knees and of natural size, with the background of a dark
sky. The hands have been praised; but they do not look as if
they could move."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p><b>A Good Portrait of Gerard Reinst.</b>&mdash;A Portrait of Gerard
Reinst, a celebrated art collector of Amsterdam, who died
in 1658, and who was a patron of Dujardin, is painted
sympathetically. He is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'bare-headed' and 'bareheaded' were used in this text. This was retained.">bareheaded</ins>, with a blond wig,
and is dressed in a grayish violet with chocolate tones.
One hand rests on his hip; the other is marvellously represented.
A landscape and sky form the background, and
two greyhounds are at the gentleman's side.</p>

<p><b>A Portrait of Himself.</b>&mdash;A portrait of himself is signed
and dated 1660. This is only nine inches by six and one-half
inches. It is only a bust showing a shaven face with a
thread of a moustache, long black hair, brilliant eyes, and
handsome mouth. He wears a grayish costume with puffed
sleeves, and his right hand somewhat pretentiously holds
the drapery of his cloak on his chest.</p>

<p><b>Dujardin's Other Works.</b>&mdash;A Landscape, dated 1655,
and showing a peasant winnowing corn, is noted for its
silvery tone; A Trumpeter on Horseback shows a cavalier
in a blue mantle and on a white horse, stopping before the
door of an inn, and drinking from a glass offered by the
hostess, who is standing at the door. His other works are
an Italian Landscape with Animals and The Muleteers.
Another Landscape in the Van der Hoop Collection was
bought at the Duchesse de Berry's sale in 1837 for 4,000
florins. A copy after Karel Dujardin shows an Italian
Landscape with figures, and a white horse.</p>

<p><b>Adam Pynacker.</b>&mdash;Adam Pynacker has four landscapes:
Border of a Lake in Italy, Italian Landscape, Landscape,
and Pilgrimage.</p>

<p><b>Johannes Both's Pictures.</b>&mdash;Johannes Both may be
studied in The Courtyard of a Farm; two Italian Landscapes,
one of which is a luminous picture of a summer
morning, with mountains on the horizon on the left, trees
to the right in the foreground, and many small figures on
the road; and in Painters Studying from Nature. Here
we see on a canvas about six feet by seven, a vast landscape
of much beauty, having the Apennines for a background.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Beneath a tall oak tree on the right and among the rocks,
Johannes Both himself is seated, with his back turned to
the spectator. He has a sketch book before him and is
talking to a beggar; his brother Andries is facing us; and
the fourth person is talking to some one in the distance.
The time is a beautiful Summer morning.</p>

<p><b>Jan Asselijn.</b>&mdash;Jan Asselijn (1610-60) was a pupil of

This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>, but went when young to Italy, where
he was called by the band of Dutch painters "Krabbetje,"
on account of a contraction in his fingers. His pictures
are highly valued, representing, as a rule, views of Rome,
enriched with figures and cattle in the style of N. Berchem.
He greatly resembles Jan Both.</p>

<p>His Italian Landscape in the Rijks is considered a very
true and important landscape, with a background of bluish
mountains, and a bridge on the left. The artist has introduced
Italian ruins and some muleteers. He is also represented
by a Cavalry Combat, signed and dated 1646; and
the Allegory on John de Witt.</p>

<p><b>Philips <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>'s Hawking Scene.</b>&mdash;Of the thirteen
pictures by Philips Wouwermans we may pause before
the well-known Hawking Scene, noted as a specimen of his
delicacy and precision on a small scale. It is only one foot
high by eight inches wide. The exceedingly animated
composition shows about a dozen people on horseback
scattered through a delicate landscape. Other figures of
men, women, and children enliven the scene. This is
painted in his last and most prized period.</p>

<p><b>His Horse-pond.</b>&mdash;The Horse-pond is a lovely picture,
with a silvery sky filled with luminous morning clouds, and,
far away in the distance, hills, trees, and women bleaching
linen. In the centre of the picture, a lovely stream in
which children are bathing, and a ferry with persons and
animals passing over in little boats. It is the moment
when grooms and peasants are taking their horses and
animals to water; and naturally, therefore, we have some
beautiful groups: here a man is leading two horses, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
which is kicking at a barking dog; other horses are at the
edge of the stream; others have plunged in. Among the
eight horses, there is one splendid white one, and there
are about twenty figures, including washerwomen and children.
It is impossible, even with <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>, who is
so <i>spirituel</i> and clever, to find a richer, more animated,

<p>A Landscape with Water belongs to the first period when
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins> followed Wijnants; The Camp shows horsemen
and other people; a horseman turned to the right and
mounted on a white and brown horse is very remarkable.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Kicking White Horse.</b>&mdash;A celebrated
canvas is The Kicking White Horse. Two mounted horses
and one lead horse are under a tree in the foreground. The
white horse, after having knocked over an old woman
with a basket of fruit, is kicking the lead horse on the right,
while a dog is snarling at his heels. On the extreme left, a
richly dressed lady and gentleman are watching the affair
with interest, and in the middle distance, on the right, two
men are watering their horses at a ford. There is fine
painting of distance in the low landscape and beautiful a&euml;rial
perspective in the Summer sky with its floating clouds.</p>

<p>Besides landscapes, a camp, and others in his usual style,
there are two pictures of fighting peasants.</p>

<p>His brother, Pieter <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins> (1623-82), is represented
by two works: Assault on the Town of Koevorden,
1672, and The Hunting Party. His works have frequently
been mistaken for Philips's, though, as may be seen in these
pictures, his brush work has less freedom, and his tones are
heavier than his brother's.</p>

<p><b>Jan Wijnants Unsuccessful in peopling his Scenery.</b>&mdash;Jan
Wijnants (1600-79), who is said to have been the
master of Philips <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>, has eight pictures by which
his qualities may be compared with those of that painter.
These are Landscape in the Dunes, with Hunters; Mountainous
Country; The Farm; and Flock in a Landscape;
and four landscapes in the Van der Hoop Collection. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
was a painter of extreme care and finish; and in painting
nature he ranks among the highest. Like so many other
Dutch landscape-painters, however, he was not successful
with figures; and for peopling his scenery he availed himself
of the assistance of his great pupil, Adriaen

others.</p>

<p><b>Jan Wijnants's Love of painting the Dunes.</b>&mdash;Durand
Gr&eacute;ville says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"His dated pictures are of his last period, 1641-79, so that
he may claim the honor of first having introduced into the landscape
the neighboring dunes of Haarlem and of having been
the first to love them. He faithfully translated in their blond harmony
the dunes, gray or golden, with the sun, the trees with
their pale foliage, and the skies with their light vaporous veilings.
To his last hour he went back again and again to that
inexhaustible theme in its apparent monotony. He put into the
execution of the dazzle of the sand, tree-trunks, spaces of moss
and clumps of grasses an astonishing sincerity, perhaps even
somewhat too minute from the point of view of the impression
of the whole, but, even by that, quite accessible to the taste of
the majority of people. None the less he remains to-day one of
the most remarkable landscape-painters of Holland."</p></div>

<p><b>Cornelis van Poelenburg.</b>&mdash;Cornelis van Poelenburg
has four characteristic pictures in his favorite Italian style:
The Bathers, Women Coming from the Bath, Adam and Eve
Expelled from Paradise, and The Bathers Spied Upon.</p>

<p><b>Winter Scenes by A. van der Neer.</b>&mdash;The most noted
painter of winter scenes and of the magic beauty of snow
and ice is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Aart' and 'Aert' van der Neer were used in this text. This was retained.">Aart</ins> van der Neer (1603-77), a friend of A.
Cuijp, from whom he doubtless learned much, as they frequently
worked together on the same canvas. His winter
pieces are generally warm in their lighting. Two fine specimens
hang in this gallery, one of which is brightened by
numerous figures skating and playing ball on a frozen canal.
The sky is full of dark snow-clouds. He may also be
studied by a Landscape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p><b>His Moonlight Scenes.</b>&mdash;He is also famous for his
beautiful towns on the canals, lighted by the moon, and his
conflagrations. No other painter has depicted the broad
masses of shadow, and the effects of light and tranquillity
of character peculiar to a moonlight night, with so much
truthfulness as Van der Neer. In his rendering of the
warm glow of sunset he has been compared to his friend
Cuijp.</p>

<p><b>Hendrick Averkamp.</b>&mdash;In this connection The Skaters,
by Hendrick Averkamp (1585-after 1663), should be noted.
This artist was surnamed "the Mute of Kampen" because
of his taciturnity. He produced many marines, landscapes,
and festivals on the ice, which have, unfortunately, lost their
color.</p>

by Esais van de Velde will afford pleasure to the student,
who may also see this artist's Dutch Landscape, painted in
1623; The Surrender of Bois-le-Duc (1629-30), and an
original replica of his curious satire on religious quarrels
in 1618-19, Prince Maurice Fastening Bells on a Cat.
Many of the architectural painters have depicted the well-known
street scenes and buildings under the mantle of
winter.</p>

<p><b>Three Excellent Pictures by Hendrik Dubbels.</b>&mdash;Hendrik
Dubbels (1620-76?), about whom comparatively
little is known, has three pictures of great excellence: A
Marine, a Calm, and a River Scene. Dubbels is supposed
to have taught <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ludolf' and 'Lodewijk' Backhuysen/ Bakhuysen were used in this text. This was retained.">Ludolf</ins> Bakhuysen (1631-1708), who was

<p><b>Bakhuysen, Painter of Stormy Seas.</b>&mdash;Bakhuysen loved
the ocean in its angry moods, and used to hire fishermen
to take him out in their boats in the fury of storms. His
works are highly valued, and some critics prefer them to
the more placid pictures of Willem <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>. The

van de Velde the Elder (1611-93), who was Court Painter to
Charles II. and James II. of England, is represented in the
Rijks by eleven marine drawings. We have already seen
fine examples of his more famous son, Willem van de Velde,
at the Mauritshuis, but thirteen splendid examples hang in
this gallery.</p>

<p><b>Some Notable Pictures of Naval Warfare.</b>&mdash;The Ij (or
Y) at Amsterdam, dated 1686, which formerly hung in the
Schreierstoren in Amsterdam, was described by Sir Joshua
Reynolds as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"At the office of the Commissary of the Wharfs is one of

</div>

<p>The Four Days' Combat is a picture of the moment when
the English flag-ship, the "Prince Royal," is striking her
colors in the fight with the Dutch fleet in 1666; and its
companion, The Capture, shows four English men-of-war
brought in as prizes in the same fight. Here the painter
has represented himself in a small boat, for in such a position
he actually witnessed the battle. An Agitated Sea,
with various sailing-vessels, is delightful because of the
warm lighting and movement of the waves; two Calms
represent the painter in the mood he best loves to paint
the sea. Other canvases represent the sea under squalls,
light breezes, etc. The Canon Shot, with a large ship in
the foreground, was bought in 1834 for 3,000 florins.</p>

<p><b>A Beautiful Picture of the Dutch Coast.</b>&mdash;View on the
Coast of Scheveningen shows the dunes on the right, above
which rises the steeple of a church; on the left is the calm
sea under a lovely afternoon light. Two fishing-boats are
seen in the distance; a boat lies on the beach; a fisherman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
walks by with his nets, and in the foreground are three
men. The sea, the dunes, the tiny figures, and the light all
combine to make a beautiful picture.</p>

<p><b>How some Painters helped each Other.</b>&mdash;The great
geniuses could do everything well&mdash;portraits, landscapes,
marines, figure subjects, architecture, interiors, and still
life. Some, however, excelled in one particular branch, and,
sometimes against their will bowed to the popular demand
for their works in that line, and devoted themselves entirely
to it. This specialization was carried to great lengths; and
it seems strange to us to find one master of landscape calling
upon a famous figure-painter to people his landscapes
<i>&agrave; la mode</i>, and <i>vice versa</i>, as happened in numberless instances.
Sometimes even cattle were supplied; and, more
particularly, live and dead game, flowers, fruits, household
stuff, and all kinds of still life.</p>

<p><b>The Effect of this on their Reputation.</b>&mdash;Sometimes a
young artist's facility in a certain field was detrimental to
high esteem. Paul Potter, for example, had to live down
the reproach that he was nothing but a painter of animals,&mdash;which
he very quickly did. Those who made a specialty
of live animals apart from landscape are very few. With
the exception of the works of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Frans 'Snijders,' 'Snyders,' 'Snyder,' and 'Synders' were used in this text. This was retained.">Snyders</ins>, hunting scenes are
rare. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>'s hunts are confined to the start and the
return of the cavalcades.</p>

<p><b>Blanc's Description of Weenix's Style.</b>&mdash;J. B. Weenix
must have loved hunting also, for it forms one of the familiar
motives in his landscapes in the Italian style. However,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"as he painted above all for the pleasure of painting, his
usual custom was to group in the foreground of his composition
the products of the chase rather than to represent the hunt
itself. It is only in the distance that hounds and huntsmen
are seen hunting the hare, while the poor animal is already
dead and hanging by its foot to a branch of a tree in the foreground.
A brilliant gamecock, one or two partridges, some
ribbons and flowers, and a big garden vase will accompany the
hare and form a charming picture for the mere delight of the
eyes. Truth, finesse of local color, delightful light and shade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
exquisite handling, and the whole technique of art are employed
to make us admire this still life. We cannot help noticing the
masterly manner in which the artist has rendered the fur of his
dead hare, crimsoned with blood; and how lovingly he has
caressed the plumage of the neck and crop of his partridges,
and reproduced the beautiful lustrous black of the cock, whose
wings are splashed with white; how he has made us feel the
velvet of the skin at the joining of the muscles, and accentuated
the feet and claws. But the final luxury of the palette seems to
have been reserved for a superb hunting-dog with delicate ears,
that watches with an eye full of life over his master's gun and
the glorious trophies of the chase; and distends his nostrils
as if to snuff the odor of the gunpowder, the aroma of the
gin, and the strong scents of the venison."</p></div>

<p><b>Painters of Still Life.</b>&mdash;Usually the painters of inanimate
objects take the trouble to arrange their inert models, just
as a historical painter would dispose his living figures.
The human figures in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Frans 'Snijders,' 'Snyders,' 'Snyder,' and 'Synders' were used in this text. This was retained.">Snyders</ins>'s pictures were painted by
Rubens, Jordaens, or Martin de Vos. His pupils were
Jan Fyt, Nicasius Bernarts, and Pieter Boel. The Rijks
Gallery has two splendid pictures by him: one, a dish
garnished with fruits and dead game; and the other, a
dead roebuck, a wild boar's head, and vegetables.</p>

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: Frans 'Snijders,' 'Snyders,' 'Snyder,' and 'Synders' were used in this text. This was retained.">Snyders</ins>'s Dead Game and Vegetables.</b>&mdash;Beautiful in
composition and color is his Dead Game and Vegetables.
On a shelf are placed choice specimens of china, glass,
earthenware, fruit stands, etc., and these are balanced on
the left by a beautiful glass vase of roses and iris standing
in a niche. A large basket of apples, peaches, melons,
pears, and grapes, a hung deer, a boar's head, a lobster,
a few artichokes, and a bunch of asparagus show the
artist's wonderful arrangement of form and color.</p>

<p><b>Savery's Landscapes and other Pictures.</b>&mdash;Roelandt Savery
(1576-1639) was famous as a landscape-painter. The
landscapes are somewhat artificial, and really are used as
framework for the animal life he loved to introduce. His
execution is sometimes rather heavy but with strong tones.
The landscapes usually consist of grassy swards with
brownish-green trees and shrubs in the foreground, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the background is bathed in the bluish tints so dear to
Brueghel. Animals and birds of all kinds animate Savery's
pictures, as well as human figures, all drawn with much
talent. The Hague has a famous picture, by this artist, of
Orpheus Charming the Animals; and the Rijks owns Elijah
Fed by the Ravens (1634) and A Stag Hunt in a Rocky
Landscape (1626).</p>

<p><b>Adriaen van Utrecht and his Still Life.</b>&mdash;Adriaen van
Utrecht was ten years ahead of Jan Fyt in painting those
pictures of live or dead animals, game, fruits, and implements
of the chase that we still admire so much. Although
his lights are sometimes somewhat heavy and his brush
work is not so fine as Fyt's, yet he equals the latter in certainty
of touch and especially in his feeling for life and
nature. His pictures are very scarce: Amsterdam possesses
only one, called Still Life, signed and dated 1644.
On a canvas eight by ten feet the painter has grouped pies,
hams, a lobster, grapes, peaches, and lemons on a table.
On the left, on the floor, are some musical instruments; on
a chair some golden vases; above, a parrot; on the right
a great sculptured basin and a little white spaniel, and in
the centre a monkey playing with some fruit from an overturned
basket.</p>

Hondecoeter was a pupil of his father, Gijsbert d' Hondecoeter
(1604-53), the pupil of his father Gillis d' Hondecoeter
(1583-1638), a painter of portraits and landscapes
in the manner of R. Savery and David Vinck Boons. Gijsbert
followed his father's style of landscapes; but he attained a
great reputation for his birds, and particularly his ducks.
Both styles may be seen in the Rijks: A Landscape with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Figures, dated 1652, and Aquatic Birds, dated 1651. In
the duck pond, where ducks and pigeons are sporting, is
also a feather floating on the water, for the artist was fond
of repeating this little touch.</p>

<p>The Philosophical Magpie regards from a tree-trunk a
dead heron, a goose, and ducks; its pendant shows a living
peacock near a large vase and a dead hare and pheasant.
Dead Game, a small picture, exhibits a dead partridge
and a string of four little birds, and the others represent
parrots and other exotic birds, flowers, and plants, and
some monkeys. The Frightened Hen is defending her
chickens against the attack of a pea-hen. The most famous
of all, however, is The Floating Feather.</p>

right are ducks and geese of various breeds; a magpie cleaves
the air with rapid wings; and, lastly, a light feather floats on the

<p><b>Asselijn's Allegorical Bird Picture.</b>&mdash;The curious Allegory
of the Vigilance of the Grand Pensionary John de Witt
by Jan Asselijn is a bird picture. Here a great white swan
is defending her nest against the attack of a black dog
swimming rapidly toward it. Beneath the swan is the
Dutch legend The Grand Pensionary; on the eggs, Holland;
and under the dog, The Enemy of the State (intended
for England). The feather lost by the bird is
beautifully painted, and has challenged comparison with

<p><b>Eckhout.</b>&mdash;G. van der Eckhout (1621-74) has a Huntsman
with Two Greyhounds, painted about 1670. The
huntsman, wearing a red vest, is seated on the grayish earth.
The general tone of the picture is chocolate or chestnut.</p>

<p><b>Jan Vonck.</b>&mdash;Jan Vonck (1630-?), another painter
who devoted himself principally to still life, especially dead
birds, sometimes was responsible for the birds in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>'s
pictures. His brush work is that of a master; his color is
strong and agreeable with a transparent touch. The Rijks
owns one example, Dead Birds.</p>

<p><b>Jan Weenix.</b>&mdash;Jan Weenix (1640-1719) was the pupil
of his celebrated father during the latter's lifetime; and
later he studied still life under his uncle G. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins>,
Elias Vonck (brother of Jan), and Matthys Bloem. He surpassed
his father in his pictures of dead game, one of which
hangs in this gallery. His animals&mdash;swans, hares, and
various birds, arranged with flowers and fruits around sumptuous
antique vases&mdash;are not so strong in character as those
in Hondecoeter's works; but they are very true to nature
and have the great charm of harmony and picturesqueness.
They richly deserve their original popularity which
their wonderful finish and execution have preserved till the
present day.</p>

<p><b>Coninck a Good Animal-painter.</b>&mdash;David de Coninck
(1636-87), who had many affinities with Fyt, also painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
landscapes, animals, and birds. He received the nickname
Ramelaer from his fondness for painting rabbits especially.
He was quite at home in hunting scenes, two of which are
in the Rijks,&mdash;The Bear Hunt and The Stag Hunt.</p>

<p>Another painter of this period, Pieter Jan Ruijven
(1651-1716), has a fine picture of a cock and hens.</p>

<p><b>Bosch, an Early Painter of Flowers.</b>&mdash;One of the early
Dutch painters of flowers was L. J. van den Bosch (?-1517),
who painted with a transparent color and a light touch. He
treated fruits, flowers, and insects with sympathy and truth.
He often represented flowers in vases; his insects are so
minute that they have to be examined with a magnifying
glass.</p>

<p><b>Delff's Poultry Seller.</b>&mdash;Pictures of this school, however,
do not abound in the Dutch galleries till we come to the
artists who lived a century later. The first of these who
appears in the Rijks is Cornelis Jacobsz Delff (1571-1643),
a pupil of Cornelis Cornelisz. Delff was renowned for his
pictures of still life. He is represented in the Rijks by The
Poultry Seller.</p>

<p><b>Other Still-life Painters in this Gallery.</b>&mdash;Other still-life
painters born in the sixteenth century, who are represented
in this gallery, are Ambrosius Bosschaert (1570-?), Pieter
Noort (1592-1650), Pieter Symonsz Potter (1597-1652),
Adriaen van Utrecht (1599-1652), and Hans Boulengier
(1600-45). Bosschaert has a picture, Flowers, dated 1619.
He had a son of the same name who also painted flowers.</p>

<p>Of Pieter Noort little is known beyond the fact that he
painted still life, and especially Fish, as in the two pictures
here signed P. van Noort.</p>

<p>P. S. Potter painted on glass and was the manager of a
gilded leather establishment at Amsterdam. His model was
Hals. Besides portraits and landscapes, his preference was
for still life. The Straw Cutter and Still Life (signed and
dated 1646) are worthy of attention.</p>

<p><b>Two Pictures by Heem of Utrecht.</b>&mdash;Jan Davidsz de
Heem (1606-84) of Utrecht was a son of David de Heem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
so famous for his <i>d&eacute;jeuners</i> spread with game, oysters, lobsters,
fruits, wine, china, glass, and silver. Jan inherited
his father's tastes, and much of his talent, as is evidenced
by two pictures in the Rijks. One shows flowers and fruits of
natural size; and the other represents a table on which are a
cup, a glass, and a vase of wrought silver loaded with fruits.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Gr&eacute;ville on his Style.</b>&mdash;"At Antwerp, under Seghers, he
enriched his palette and learned the art of composing a delicious
harmony by setting flowers and fruits and glass and silver vases
on an Oriental <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'table-cloth' and 'tablecloth' were used in this text. This was retained.">table-cloth</ins>. To the most minute exactitude and
almost microscopic details, he added the most brilliant coloring
and an unfailing taste in the arrangement of his flowers and
still life."</p></div>

<p><b>Pieter de Ring.</b>&mdash;A picture of a table covered with blue
velvet and spread with lobsters, oysters, bread, fruit, etc., is
typical of the work of Pieter de Ring (1615-60), one of
De Heem's pupils, a Fleming, who spent his whole life in
Holland, and was noted for his picturesque arrangement and
fine execution.</p>

<p>Hans Boulengier has a flower piece signed 1625. He
painted still life, <i>genre</i>, and sometimes "fantasmagories."
Little is known about him.</p>

<p><b>Still-life Painters in the Latter Half of the Seventeenth
Century.</b>&mdash;A generation later this school was in full blossom.
Pictures of fruits, flowers, and dead game, by artists
who flourished in the second half of the seventeenth century,
are fairly plentiful.</p>

<p>Abraham Hendricksz van Beyeren (1620-74) painted
with fine composition and strong color breakfast pictures
in the style of David de Heem, and delighted in portraying
fish as in the Rijks example.</p>

<p>Cornelis Bris&eacute; (1622-7-) painted portraits; this gallery
possesses one of his pictures of flowers, signed C. Bris&eacute;,
1665. On the wall beside it hangs another flower piece
by the brush of Elias van Broeck (?-1708).</p>

<p><b>De Snuffelaer.</b>&mdash;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Otho Marcellis' and 'Otto Marseus' (or vice versa) were used in this text. This was retained.">Otto Marseus</ins> van Schrieck (1619-78)
was nicknamed De Snuffelaer (the ferreter), by the Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
art colony in Rome, because of his frequent country walks
to discover new plants, insects, and reptiles as models for
his compositions. He painted with wonderful finish, good
drawing, and truth to nature, as may be seen in his Insects,
Lizards, etc., here signed O. M. V. S.</p>

<p>Jacob Marrel (1614-81) has a flower piece signed and
dated 1634. Among other masters in Utrecht, Frankfort,
Brussels, and Antwerp, he studied with J. D. de Heem.</p>

<p><b>Kalff, a Good Painter and a Brilliant Talker.</b>&mdash;Willem
Kalff (1622-93) was the pupil of Henry Pot, and as soon
as he left the master he abandoned his manner, choosing
for his subjects vegetables, fruits, kitchen utensils, and
sometimes handsome vases. Houbraken says he spent
whole days before a lemon, a beautiful orange, and the
agate or mother-of-pearl handle of a dessert-knife; and the
vessels of Holland never brought home a single shell, the
strange form and splendid colors of which he did not copy.</p>

<p>Unlike many of the Dutch painters of his day, who spent
most of their time in the tavern, Kalff was a man of charming
and distinguished manner and a brilliant talker, and he
possessed a witty and cultivated mind. His friends would
spend the entire night listening to his conversation, and
when he died from an accidental fall from the bridge at
Bantem, the poet Willem van der Hoeven wrote a eulogy
in which he said that Willem Kalff "knew how to paint
golden vases and silver cups and all the treasures of opulence,
but no treasures could outweigh his merit, for he had
no equal in his line."</p>

<p><b>His Favorite Subjects.</b>&mdash;The kitchen with Kalff became
a heroic subject, and over it he threw the most subtle effects
of chiaroscuro, throwing a gleam of light upon a well, a
scoured saucepan, or a bunch of vegetables. Who is the
hero or heroine of the scene? A fine cauldron or saucepan
or kettle shining with a thousand reflected lights that come
through a window of thick glass or yellow paper. An old
cask stands by, interesting us with all its details of decay,&mdash;its
swollen staves, its rusted hoops, and the insects that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
lodge in the rotten wood. A big nail, an earthen pot, a
skimmer, a few onions with their shining skins, a broom, a
jug of water, and a towel lying on a barrel,&mdash;with such
simple things he makes a beautiful picture. Perhaps in
the background the cook and her dog are discerned. Kalff
never allows figures to become too prominent, for he wishes
his still life to catch and hold the spectator's interest.</p>

<p>The picture by this artist in the Rijks has for its subject
a silver vase, of elegant form, and a porcelain dish filled
with oranges and lemons. The objects are tastefully
arranged and beautifully painted.</p>

<p><b>Some other Painters of Animals and Fruits.</b>&mdash;Anthonie
Leemans (1630-8-) has also a characteristic picture of
still life; he was fond of painting dead birds. Another
picture of dead birds is by Willem G. Fergusson (1632-9-),
a Scotchman, who hired a house at The Hague in 1660,
and another in 1668; he was living in Amsterdam in 1681.
The picture is dated 1662. A Garland of Fruits is signed
J. Borman, who flourished in Leyden in 1657 and 1658;
but about him little is known. Another notable canvas
belonging to this school is Animals, Insects, and Fruits,
by Anthony van Borssom (1629-77), who was probably a
pupil, and certainly an admirer of Rembrandt; his tones
are somewhat sombre, but his drawing is vigorous and full
of interest. R. van der Burgh (fl. 1680) has a lifelike
painting of Sea Fish; and Karel Batist is a little-known
flower-painter, who worked in Amsterdam in 1659; his
canvas is unusually large for this <i>genre</i>, though the student
will have noticed that most of the artists of this period
liked to paint their flowers and fruits natural size.</p>

<p>Pieter Claes van Haerlem (d. 1660) has a small picture
of still life which bears the false signature, Johan de Heem,
1640; and Jan van Kessel (1626-79) has a much smaller
one of Fruits and Insects. Another picture by the latter,
representing a woman seated at a table with fruits, etc., on
it, is falsely attributed to Anna Maria van Schurman (1607-78),
who was called "the marvel of her century." Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
great reputation probably prompted some dealer to attempt
the fraud. None of the principal galleries of Europe possesses
any examples of her pictures, insects, etc., so celebrated
during her lifetime.</p>

<p>Another picture of Flowers, dated 1667, is by Nicolaes
Lachtropius, who was a famous Dutch painter of coach
panels during the second half of the seventeenth century.
A contemporary German painter, Ottomar Elliger (1633-79),
also has a flower piece, dated 1674.</p>

<p><b>Mignon, a First-class Flower-painter.</b>&mdash;Abraham Mignon
(1640-79) was a pupil of J. D. de Heem. He had
as pupils in the same style, two daughters and M. S.
M&eacute;rian. He belongs to the first rank of flower-painters.
P&eacute;ries says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The qualities which distinguish the works of Mignon are
freshness, delicacy of tone, finish, the splendor of the reflections,
and the perfect imitation of nature. His flowers are selected
with taste and he perfectly well understands the art of giving
them their full value. He equally excels in painting insects,
flies, and butterflies, and the dewdrops trembling on the leaves;
the velvety skin of his fruits invites the touch of the fingers.
His only fault is perhaps a dryness in his draughtsmanship."</p></div>

<p><b>Some of his Pictures.</b>&mdash;His masterpiece, <i>Mignon au
Chat</i>, showing a Persian cat upsetting a vase of flowers
on a marble table, is in the Rijks. Another picture here
is Fruits, representing a dish with grapes and pomegranates,
besides oysters and white bread. In composition, warmth,
harmony, and truth to nature this belongs to his best work.
Inferior to this is Flowers, where flowers appear in a vase,
and a cat and a mouse-trap are also represented. Still
Life and Fruits shows a marble table, on which are fruits
and flowers, a boiled lobster and an antique vase, a picture
that approaches his master Jan de Heem in harmony and
softness of touch.</p>

<p><b>How Jan <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Vanhuysum,' 'Van Huysum,' and 'Huysum' were used in this text. This was retained.">van Huysum</ins> became a Great Fruit and Flower
painter.</b>&mdash;Jan van Huysum was the son of a flower-painter
who had turned his house into a sort of factory where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
everything contributing to the decoration of rooms and gardens
could be found. Jan, who was placed at the head of the
enterprise, grew tired of the business side and devoted himself
to art, especially the works of Mignon, Verelst, and
David de Heem. He also closely studied nature, and seeing
a whole world unfold itself in the study of flowers
alone, he explored the furthest recesses of his domain;
birds, butterflies, beetles, wasps, bees,&mdash;he forgot none
of the satellites of the flowers. Being also surrounded with
examples of all the exterior and interior art decorations
of the day, he was able to copy the marble consoles that
served as supports for his baskets, the earthenware bowls
and vases in which he kept his bouquets fresh, and the
bas-reliefs that set off the flowers in those vases, and the
mascarons and chim&aelig;ras that formed the handles. It may
be said of him as a French critic said of Baptiste: "His
beautiful flowers lacked only the perfume that they seemed
to exhale." Reynolds must also have been thinking of
Huysum's effects when he said that Rubens's pictures were
"bouquets of colors." Huysum's fruits have received some
criticism: some critics hold that he has given them the
look of wax and the polish of ivory. In this branch of his
art, he perhaps falls short of David de Heem. His peaches
are too firm, his plums not provocative of thirst, and his
grapes leave a little more ripeness, gold, and sun to be
desired. He succeeded better with red gooseberries and
the cleft pomegranates with their pulp and seeds sparkling
like rubies and delightful to the eye. The Rijks Museum
has five pictures by this master in which his qualities as
a fruit and flower painter are fully displayed.</p>

<p><b>His Landscapes.</b>&mdash;A small landscape is also here.
Formerly <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Vanhuysum,' 'Van Huysum,' and 'Huysum' were used in this text. This was retained.">Huysum</ins>'s landscapes were as highly prized and
as costly as his flower pieces. However, his works in this
field are echoes merely of Guaspre, Glauber, Poussin, and
Claude; he lived in an age when the Dutch again bowed
down before foreign idols. The familiar Dutch pastures
were now peopled with nymphs and demigods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Conrad Roepel.</b>&mdash;Conrad Roepel (1678-1748) was
famous for his flowers, fruits, festoons, garlands, birds, and
insects. He painted with much truth and good color.
He studied under C. Netscher; but later he took <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Vanhuysum,' 'Van Huysum,' and 'Huysum' were used in this text. This was retained.">Huysum</ins>
for his model. The Rijks has a picture of Flowers and
another of Fruits by him, both signed and dated 1721.</p>

<p><b>The Van Os Family.</b>&mdash;Jan van Os (1744-1808) was
greatly admired in his day as a painter of marines, landscapes,
and more particularly flowers and fruits. There is
one of the latter here. His son and pupil, Georgius
Jacobus Johannes (1782-1861), was equally famous as
a painter of flowers and game. He is represented here
by four pictures, one of which is a landscape, the animals
of which are painted by his brother <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Peter Gerhardus' and 'Pieter Gerardus' were used in this text. This was retained.">Peter Gerhardus</ins> (1776-1839).
The latter painted chiefly military and hunting
scenes, landscapes, and animals. Nine canvases exhibit his
qualities in this gallery. His sister Marie Margrita van Os
(1780-1862) was, like her brothers, a pupil of Jan van Os;
she has a Still Life in the Rijks.</p>

<p><b>Eight of Gerrit Dou's Pictures.</b>&mdash;Gerrit Dou is represented
by eight works including the famous Evening School
which in 1808 was sold for 17,500 florins. The others are
his own Portrait; the Portrait of a Man, dated 1646; Portraits
of a Gentleman and his Wife, in a landscape painted
by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Nicholas' and 'Nicolaes' Berchem were used in this text. This was retained.">Nicholas</ins> Berchem; <i>La Curieuse</i>, a small oval picture of
a girl with a lamp in her hand; a Hermit in Prayer in a
Grotto; a Hermit, dated 1664; and A Fisherwoman.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Evening School.</b>&mdash;The Evening School
is the most important of all Dou's candle-light pictures.
The composition is very simple. A looped curtain is lifted
to reveal a room poorly furnished with benches and tables.
The schoolmaster, who sits at a table with his arm on a
small desk, is hearing a girl spell, and shaking his finger at
a boy who is walking away. This group is lighted by a
candle that stands on the table near an hour-glass. In the
background a small group is seen at a table also lighted
by a candle. On the left of the teacher a boy is making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
calculations on a slate, while a girl by his side looks on, holding
a lighted candle in her hand. A fourth light&mdash;from a
large lantern on the floor&mdash;adds another artificial light for
the painter to treat. This great work is painted on a panel
1 foot 8 inches high by 1 foot 3 inches long.</p>

<p><b>The Fisherman's Wife.</b>&mdash;The Fisherman's Wife, painted
in 1653, shows an old woman in a black gown with yellow
sleeves and a man's round hat. She is holding a reel.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Hermit.</b>&mdash;The Hermit is one of the
most marvellously finished works of the master in his most
minute style. You can count the wrinkles and hairs of the
old white-bearded man who holds a crucifix in his hands.
An open book, an hour-glass, a can, and a basket (for
bread and wine or water) and other accessories are painted
in miniature; on the right is seen the trunk of a tree, and
in the far distance are some arcades, probably cloisters.
The tiny panel is only ten by eight inches.</p>

<p><b>Schalcken, Imitator of Dou and Rembrandt.</b>&mdash;Godfried
Schalcken was the pupil of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Hoogstraten,' 'Hoogstraaten,' and 'Hooghstraten' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hoogstraten</ins>, and of Dou, whom
he skilfully imitated. The sight of some of Rembrandt's
pictures next led him to devote himself to the effects of
light, artificial light especially: the majority of his pictures
therefore are illuminated by lamp or candle light. His most
remarkable work is at Amsterdam. It is called Young Girl
Lighting a Lantern. At the Revolution, he accompanied
William III. to England, and painted portraits of that king,
one of which, signed with the artist's name and dated 1699,
is in The Hague Gallery. Among his best pictures is the Boy
Eating an Egg, in the Rijks Museum.</p>

<p><b>His Portrait of William III.</b>&mdash;The half-length portrait of
William III. in the same gallery, in which there is a remarkable
play of light, shows that this master who delighted in
the composition of small subjects borrowed from common
life, was equally capable of painting pictures of natural size.</p>

<p>Schalcken's chief merit consists in the neatness of his finishing
and the perfect intelligence of his chiaroscuro. His touch
is mellow, but too fused, and his color warm and golden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p><b>His Other Pictures.</b>&mdash;The other pictures here are A
Young Man Smoking; Difference in Taste, in which two
men are talking, while another lights his pipe; and two
Female Portraits, one of an ambassador's daughter, and the
other her companion.</p>

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Slingelandt' and 'Slingerlandt' were used in this text. This was retained.">Slingelandt</ins>, Another Imitator of Dou.</b>&mdash;Pieter Cornelisz
van Slingelandt (1640-91) is another pupil and a close
imitator of Dou; and almost surpasses him in laborious execution.
He reached the limits of what can be done by a
painter in oils. All his work seems to have been done under
the impression that imitation is the sole end of art.</p>

<p><b>His Skill in Delicately Minute Painting.</b>&mdash;Naturally he
excelled in still-life painting, in which nothing was too
minute for him to endeavor to reproduce on his canvas. His
brush indicates the weft of the most delicate tissues; the
coloring matter, almost microscopically divided, gives a tone
to every stitch in a linen hood or cap, or a knitted stocking.
On a panel of the smallest size you can sometimes distinguish
the shadow, half tone, and high light of each of the
pearls in a necklace; sometimes also a cat's whiskers, and
even the hairs on the skin of a mouse. Sometimes a piece
of lace is rendered with such labor that it took more time
to paint than to make. The consequence is that his pictures
are very scarce: not fifty are known.</p>

<p><b>His Favorite Subjects.</b>&mdash;Though as a rule he preferred
the luxury and elegance of high life, with its marbles and
richly carved furniture, upholstery and tapestry, jewels and
laces, silks and satins, velvets and furs, he also sometimes
chose models of humble estate. The Rehearsal is a masterpiece
in this class. Here a man is playing a violin while a
boy is singing and a woman preparing dinner. The other
example of his art is quite in contrast with the above. It is
called The Rich Man, and on it <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Slingelandt' and 'Slingerlandt' were used in this text. This was retained.">Slingelandt</ins> has lavished all
the resources of his brush. Blanc says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He painted the merchant at his counter and the lacemaker
at her distaff, the housekeeper purchasing partridges or getting
dinner ready, and the woman of the people occupied in sewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
beside the cradle in which her infant is sleeping. From the
richly furnished salon <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Slingelandt' and 'Slingerlandt' were used in this text. This was retained.">Slingelandt</ins> descended to the scullery and
took pleasure in looking at the rows of shining pots and pans,
and other kitchen utensils. He observed the correct tone of the
servant's apron as well as that of the silken skirt he had painted
in her mistress's portrait. He devoted as much attention to
imitating the polish of a brass vase or the rough varnish of an
earthenware pot, as to expressing the transparency of a Bohemian
glass. Cats and mice were also honored with his precious
painting, as well as parrots and spaniels. But what he rendered
with most love and with unequalled truth was the musical instrument.
His violins are light, and sonorous; his violoncellos provoke
the virtuoso and enchant the ear almost as much as the
eye. One would say that nothing escaped his observation,
nothing of what constituted private and family life, that which
he himself lived in obscurity, the simplicity and joys of which
he painted with so much application, finish, and patience."</p></div>

<p><b>Adriaen de Vois.</b>&mdash;Arie (or Adriaen) de Vois (about
1630-80) studied first under Nicholas Knupfer in Utrecht,
next with Abraham van den Tempel, and lastly with
Pieter van <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Slingelandt' and 'Slingerlandt' were used in this text. This was retained.">Slingelandt</ins>, whose highly finished style he
followed with great success. He painted charming scenes
of familiar life, lovely portraits, interiors, and even landscapes,
in which he introduced, in the style of Poelenburg,
tiny nude figures. The Dutch collectors have always
prized them for the delicacy of their color and touch and
vivacity.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Description of The Lady with a Parrot.</b>&mdash;In his Lady
with a Parrot, the lady is rather French in type, and dressed
in the most fashionable style of the period. Her earrings are
wonderfully painted and perhaps even more realistic are the
fruits in the basket which she holds on her knee, and from
which she offers her parrot a tempting treat. Every detail
of this picture is perfect in treatment&mdash;the dress, the hair,
the face, the jewels, the still life, and the brilliant feathers
of the bird.</p>

<p><b>His Other Pictures in the Rijks.</b>&mdash;In addition to this
beautiful picture the Rijks also owns The Fisherman
Smoking, a little oval panel; A Violin Player, who holds a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
wineglass; and The Fish-Vender, a jolly old fisherman with
a glass of beer in his hand.</p>

<p><b>Seven Pictures by Brekelenkam.</b>&mdash;Quieringh Gerritsz
van Brekelenkam (?-1668) was a pupil of Gerrit Dou;
and his own manner was a mixture of Dou and Rembrandt.
He settled in Leyden in 1648. His works, representing, as a
rule, interiors, with figures noted for the natural expression
of their heads, are highly esteemed. His touch is light
and spirited, and he understands the art of chiaroscuro.
The Rijks owns seven pictures: Two Interiors, The Fireside
(1664), The Mouse Trap (1660), Confidences (1661),
Reading, and A Mother and Child. The latter is a little
oval panel, in which a woman in a red skirt and black
jacket is giving some porridge to her child.</p>

<p>One of the Interiors, representing A Tailor's Shop, is one
of his best works. The tailor, with long hair and fur cap,
is seated at a work-table on the right; he is talking to a
woman who is carrying a tin bucket. On the right, near
the window, you see the back of a young workman. In the
background hangs a picture, and there are some clothes on
a board. The work is somewhat in the style of Pieter de
Hooch.</p>

<p><b>His Poverty of Imagination.</b>&mdash;Brekelenkam has been
accused of poverty of imagination because of the paucity of
figures in his compositions; and yet some of the most beautiful
and famous pictures of the Little Masters consist of
single figures, such as a woman sitting spinning. One critic
complains:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Notwithstanding his ability (his method is preferable to
Dou's; his painting is more unctuous, warmer, and freer, being
finely accented with lifelike touches on the various utensils or
accessories of his interiors), it seems that this painter was not
endowed with a very fertile imagination. He has a very slight
taste for difficult subjects, and carefully avoids complicated
compositions; most often, indeed, a single personage suffices
him for a picture. A smoker lighting his pipe, an old woman
sitting in the chimney corner, a philosopher turning over the
leaves of a folio volume, the interior of a farm, or a kitchen,&mdash;these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
are Brekelenkam's ordinary motives. But feeling and intellect
give relief to these vulgar themes, and render the delicate
works of this too-little-known painter precious to art-lovers."</p></div>

<p>The student will be able to judge from the pictures in
the Rijks whether or no the artist deserves more or less
than this half-hearted praise.</p>

<p><b>Ter Borch's Famous Paternal Advice.</b>&mdash;Ter Borch, as
we have seen by The Message or Despatch in the Mauritshuis,
was fond of painting pictures with some slight
dramatic connection. Here we find the very famous Paternal
Advice, also called The Paternal Reproof, but better
known as The Satin Dress (<i>Robe de Satin</i>).</p>

<p>A young lady is standing with her back to the spectator.
She wears a black cape and a white satin dress, and her
hair is blond. The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'table-cloth' and 'tablecloth' were used in this text. This was retained.">table-cloth</ins>, bed curtains, and other
hangings are red. On the table at the left are a silver
candlestick, two combs, and a pink string, and a mirror or
perhaps a picture in a frame. On the right is seated a
rather young man with long hair, and richly and somewhat
extravagantly dressed in lilac and gray. In one hand he
holds a large hat trimmed with three immense blue and
lemon-colored plumes. His sword is by his side, and behind
him in the shadows stands his greyhound. His left
hand is raised with some gesture, probably of admiration,
as his face is smiling. The old woman at his side is interested
solely in her glass, through which half of her face is
seen as she is drinking.</p>

<p>It was Goethe who bestowed the name Paternal Advice
upon this picture, the story of which is not yet known; but
although critics have accepted fatherly admonition as the
theme, the relative ages of the characters do not justify the
theory.</p>

<p><b>Blanc's Critique of the Picture.</b>&mdash;Blanc is one who
does not question this. He exclaims:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Truly this dress is perfect: it is so close to the eye and
within reach of the hand that it engrosses the entire attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of the spectator. One would say that the young girl, so gently
reprimanded by her father, has come there merely for the sake
of showing her dress; and, indeed, the painter has dwelt on this
detail with the greatest affection, and, moreover, has hidden
the face of the young girl, and shown us only the back of her
head with its blond coil and the escaping tresses, in which are
mingled some black velvet, which relieves the ash-colored tone
of the hair. What a singular thing! A frightful sacrifice of a
woman's head to a robe of satin, the unheard-of triumph of an
accessory&mdash;a charming infraction against all the principles of
art&mdash;we might call it a colossal fault&mdash;but a privilege only
allowed to great artists. The painter has by this aroused our
curiosity regarding the face of the young girl, who has turned
away her head, and so we have to imagine her blushing cheeks
and her lowered eyelids. As for the father, he is remonstrating
with her so tenderly, with such a gentle gesture and so paternal
a manner that we are not disturbed by it, and can therefore fix
our glance on the magnificent satin dress, the folds of which
are so beautifully broken by the light, and in which all the interest
of the picture is concentrated. But what an inexplicable
attitude is that of the mother, who is slowly drinking a glass of
fine wine, while her husband lectures their daughter."</p></div>

<p><b>Other Pictures by Ter Borch in the Rijks.</b>&mdash;The Rijks
owns a Portrait of Ter Borch, painted by himself, and one
of his wife, Geertruida Matthyssen; a copy of The Peace
of M&uuml;nster (original in the National Gallery), and a copy of
his Boy and a Dog, also known as The Scholar.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Scholar.</b>&mdash;The latter shows a table
covered with an old gray carpet, on which is a copy-book
and an inkstand. The scholar, who instead of writing his
exercise is busy catching fleas on the dog, which he holds
between his knees, wears a violet coat and blue stockings,
and his gray hat lies on a little wooden bench before him.
The whole is of a neutral color, but very clear.</p>

<p><b>Seven Pictures by Adriaen van Ostade.</b>&mdash;Adriaen van
Ostade has seven pictures on these walls: An Artist's
Studio, Travellers' Halt (1671), The Charlatan (1648),
The Baker, The Merry Peasant, The Intimate Company
(1642), Confidences (1642).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p><b>His Artist's Studio.</b>&mdash;An Artist's Studio, of which
there is a replica dated 1666 in the Dresden Gallery, shows
a painter sitting at an easel with his back to the spectator;
he wears a violet coat and a red cap. The other features
of the composition are a black dog asleep, an assistant
grinding colors in a corner, and a pupil preparing a palette.
The artist is supposed to be Ostade himself in both instances;
but for some reason his face is half hidden. The
play of light and shadow in the apartment is noticeably
Rembrandtesque in character.</p>

<p><b>A Tavern Interior.</b>&mdash;There are two tavern interiors
here. In one (dated 1661) five peasants are grouped in
the foreground. Before a large chimney stands a man in
a blue vest and gray hat, holding a mug in his hand;
opposite is a man in a blue mantle and a white hat, who
is filling his pipe; in the chimney corner an old man is
dreaming; and to his right an old woman is listening to
what a man in a furred cap, with a pipe in his hand, is
saying to the man before the fire. On the extreme right a
little girl, on a wooden stool before a rustic table, is eating
her soup and amusing herself with a little black-and-white
dog. In the background, near the open window, five men
are grouped around a table, smoking, drinking, and talking.
The lights on the separate groups from the back and side
windows are ably managed.</p>

<p><b>Ostade's Best Period.</b>&mdash;The Charlatan, dated 1648,
belongs to the master's best period, when he painted such
gems as The Barn, The Family, and The Father of the
Family.</p>

<p>The Intimate Company, signed 1642, is in the Van der
Hoop Collection, as is also a rustic interior, <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de campagnards</i>,
signed 1661. The latter has passed through the
Lormier, Choiseul, Du Barry, Tolozon, and Duchesse de
Berry collections.</p>

<p><b>Some of his Pupils.</b>&mdash;Among Adriaen's many pupils
may be mentioned Cornelis Dusart, Cornelis Bega, Michiel
van Musscher, R. Brakenburgh, and Jan de Groot. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
all followed his style more or less closely. When Jan Steen
visited Haarlem he also fell under his influence.</p>

<p><b>Isaak van Ostade.</b>&mdash;Isaak van Ostade (1621-49) has
two rustic inns, one signed and dated 1643, that are typical
of his style. In his early work he imitated his brother and
teacher with some success, both in subject and treatment,
especially wayside hostelries. His pictures, however, are
browner in tone and harder in execution than Adriaen's.
In one picture here we see two travellers with a white horse
halting in front of an inn. The composition is delightful
and full of nature and spirit.</p>

<p><b>C. Dusart, Better in some Respects than his Master.</b>&mdash;Cornelis
Dusart (1660-1704) adopted his master's (Ostade)
style without servile imitation. He was a minute observer
of details and had an astonishing memory that enabled him
to use them to the best advantage in his interiors. His
choice and treatment of scenes were rather more distinguished
and less vulgar than some of his master's. His
later pictures are inferior to his early ones: they lack
spontaneity of conception, and that freshness and simplicity
of impression that mark so many of his works.
Five striking pictures worthily represent his abilities,&mdash;Wandering
Musicians, The Fish Market (1683), The Village
Kermesse, A Village Inn, and Maternal Happiness.</p>

<p><b>Cornelis Bega.</b>&mdash;Cornelis Bega (1620-64), another
pupil of Adriaen van Ostade, copied and improved upon
him. A Concert of Peasants is full of color, light, movement,
life, and gayety, with music, singing, and dancing.
It is warmer in color than most of his works.</p>

<p>The Grace before the Meal (1663) shows a young woman
with folded hands seated at the table, and on the other side
an old man. On the window-sill is a flower-pot; in front,
on the floor, a foot-warmer. This is a good picture, but a
little too red in tone, as often happens with Bega.</p>

<p><b>M. van Musscher's Lack of Originality.</b>&mdash;Michiel van
Musscher (1645-1705) was completely lacking in individuality:
he simply mirrored his successive masters, Martin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Zaagmorlen, Abraham van den Tempel, Gabriel Metsu, and
Adriaen van Ostade. Not only that, but he sometimes
painted also in the style of Jan Steen, and even imitated
the marvellous chiaroscuro of Pieter de Hooch. Sometimes
also in subject and treatment his work resembles that
of Netscher and Albert Cuijp. He has five portraits here,
but is not represented by an example of his many interiors,
feasts, or scenes of peasant or genteel life.</p>

<p><b>Brakenburgh, a Clever Colorist.</b>&mdash;Richard Brakenburgh
(1650-1702), a pupil of A. van Ostade, Hendrick Mommers,
and probably Jan Steen, whom he imitated, lived in
Haarlem. He also studied with B. Schendel, and became
a clever painter and very able in the management of chiaroscuro.
He is fond of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'merry-making' and 'merrymaking' were used in this text. This was retained.">merrymakings</ins>, drunken assemblies,
doctors' visits, and children's feasts. He sometimes
painted the figures in the landscapes of P. de Koninck and
others. In his best works, some competent critics consider
him worthy to rank with Ostade in the brilliance of his
color, although it is always inferior in transparency. In
form and modelling his subjects suffer by comparison with
those of his master. The Rijks owns a jovial tavern scene,
and The Feast of St. Nicholas, signed and dated 1665,
which the student will be interested in comparing with Jan
Steen's treatment of the same subject.</p>

<p><b>Several Periods in the Career of D. Teniers the Younger.</b>&mdash;David
Teniers the Younger (1610-90) has seven pictures
here that illustrate his various styles. As with most other
artists who reached old age, critics recognize several periods
in the career of Teniers. At first, his figures, from
twelve to eighteen inches high, are broadly painted in
brownish and somewhat heavy tones. Toward 1640 his
color becomes clearer and more luminous and golden.
From 1640 to 1660 it assumes silvery tones of admirable
lightness and limpidity; and, at the same time, his execution
grows more careful and precise. The pictures of
this last period are held in highest esteem. After that Teniers
returned to a gamut of golden tones, in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
sometimes displayed great power. At the close of his life
he became heavy and brownish in tone, and his touch lost
some of its clearness. Not many of his pictures are dated.
The earliest known date is 1641, on Our Corps de Garde,
a medium-sized picture of no special interest, in which we
note numerous military attributes. This is far inferior to
a similar picture, now in St. Petersburg, painted two years
later.</p>

<p><b>His Relish for Pictures of the Supernatural.</b>&mdash;The
Temptation of St. Anthony is one of many pictures he
painted in his relish for the class of subjects painted two
centuries earlier by Jerome Bosch&mdash;Dives in Hell, incantations,
witches, phantasmagoria, etc.&mdash;for the simple
purpose of assembling the most hideous and grotesque
apparitions imaginable.</p>

<p><b>His Pictures of other Kinds.</b>&mdash;The other pictures here
are devoted to his villagers, drinking, playing bowls, dancing,
singing, and fighting. A Landscape, with a rustic
house, shows a gardener standing, spade in hand, talking to a
woman with a child on her lap. On the left, on the ground,
are some vegetables, also pots and other household utensils.</p>

<p><b>Peter Balten.</b>&mdash;Peter Balten (fl. 1540-71) is represented
by a large picture, St. Martin's Fair. His figures are full
of spirit, and his touch is sure. Little is known of him
except that he was one of the greatest wits of his day. He
studied under Pierre Brueghel, whom he resembles in style.</p>

<p><b>B. van Bassen.</b>&mdash;A contemporary of his was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Bartelmees,' 'Bartholomew,' and 'Bartholomeus' van Bassen were used in this text. This was retained.">Bartholomeus</ins>
van Bassen (d. 1652), who has a fine Interior with figures
supplied by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Esais' and 'Esaias' van de Velde were used in this text. This was retained.">Esais</ins> <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>. His specialty was portraits,
with studies of perspective, and church and other
interiors.</p>

<p><b>Three Pictures by Hendrick Bloemaert.</b>&mdash;Hendrick Bloemaert
(1601-72) was probably the son of Abraham.
The Rijks has three of his pictures, signed and dated:
Winter (1631), Portrait of Johannes Puttkamer (1671), and
The Eggseller (1632). The latter is in the Van der Hoop
Room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Three Popular Artists.</b>&mdash;Jan van der Meer the Younger
(1656-1705) is represented by a charming picture, The
Sleeping Shepherd, dated 1678. Frans van Mieris the Elder
is represented by The Letter, The Lute Player, Jacob's
Dream, The Lost Bird, and Fragility. His son, Willem van
Mieris, is represented by The Poulterer (1733), A Landscape
with Shepherds and Shepherdesses (1722), and a Lady and a
Gentleman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">

 Grocer&#39;s Shop" title="" />
<span class="caption">F. VAN MIERIS<br />
Grocer&#39;s Shop</span>
</div>

<p><b>The Grocer's Shop by F. van Mieris the Younger.</b>&mdash;Willem's
son and pupil, Frans van Mieris the Younger
(1689-1763), who carried on the family traditions in Leyden,
although somewhat inferior to his father and grandfather, is
represented by A Hermit (1721), A Chemist's Shop (1714),
and The Grocer's Shop (1715). This latter picture presents
an interesting scene of the day. Note the beautiful
painting of the sculptured bas-relief of the counter, at which
stand the purchasers&mdash;an old woman and a child. The
shopkeeper holds scales and two baskets, about the contents
of which there seems to be some contention. In the shop
there is a larder, on the shelves of which various articles are
seen; baskets hang on the wall; and tubs, barrels, and
casks are also visible. Over the shop has grown a grape-vine,
and its graceful festoons of leaves make a beautiful
effect.</p>

<p><b>Several of Karel Dujardin's Pictures.</b>&mdash;Karel Dujardin
may also be studied by his Portrait of a Man; Portrait of
Gerard Reinst, a celebrated art collector of Amsterdam and
also a patron of the painter; The Muleteers; The Laborer
on his Farm (1655), in which a peasant is seen winnowing
corn; A Trumpeter on Horseback; a Portrait of Himself
(1660); an Italian Landscape with Animals; and a Landscape,
which was purchased at the Duchesse de Berry's sale
in 1837 for 4,000 florins.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Burger on A Woman Reading.</b>&mdash;"Again the sphinx!
Here we have an interior with a woman standing in profile to
the left. She is reading a letter; she wears a light blue jacket
and a grayish-blue skirt. Before her are a table and a chair with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
blue back. Behind her is another blue chair. Decidedly Van
der Meer has an affection for the blue sky. The wall of the
background is a pale moonlight blue, and the woman's figure
stands out against a geographical map a little tinted with <i>bistre</i>,
which hangs on the wall.</p>

<p>"The execution of this picture is very delicate, indeed almost
trivial: the paint is laid on very lightly, the color is weak and
even a little dry. It is true that this picture is a little rubbed.
On the contrary, Van de Meer's touch was frank and the <i>p&acirc;te
grasse</i> abundant, even somewhat exaggerated in the View of
Delft at The Hague; there is an incomparable firmness of design
and modelling in The Milkmaid in the Six Gallery; and in
the Fa&ccedil;ade of a Dutch House in the same gallery, the color is
extremely warm and harmonious. These differences of practice
make us hesitate for a time regarding the parentage of The
Woman Reading in the Van der Hoop Collection. However,
the physiognomy of this woman is of an exquisite delicacy; her
bare arms and the hand that holds the paper are marvellously
drawn.... This pale light and these delicate blues betray Van
der <i>Meer</i>. This artist probably had several styles.</p>

<p>"This picture is signed: an open book on the table bears the
word Meer."</p></div>

<p><b>Van der Meer's Later Style.</b>&mdash;In later pieces his style is
reminiscent of De Hooch and Metsu, but it is brighter and
the tone more enamelled. In most instances the scene is in
a small room lighted by a casement window. Sometimes
the painter himself is seated in a studio; sometimes a girl
and her lover are together; sometimes a woman is seated
at the clavecin. The Milkmaid in the Six Collection is
noted for its brilliancy of tone, harmonious distribution of
tints, delicacy of gradations, and solidity of touch.</p>

<p><b>His Portrait-painting.</b>&mdash;Van der Meer was also a splendid
portrait-painter and excelled in landscapes, in which he
sacrificed figures to trees, cottages, and lanes. There is a
charming little picture of this class in the Six Collection,
representing a row of brick houses with people, in the style
of Pieter de Hooch. It is said that he was killed by the
fall of his house at the time when Simon Decker, a vestryman
of the Delft Church, was sitting to him for his portrait.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Pieter de Hooch (1635-78).</b>&mdash;This master who was so
long neglected and is now regarded as at least the equal of
Ter Borch, Metsu, and Van Mieris, is well represented in the
Rijks, though absent from The Hague Gallery. His talent is
exhibited chiefly in his Conversations. Burger says he has
never seen a single picture by De Hooch that is not of the
first rank.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Burger on De Hooch's Choice of Subjects.</b>&mdash;"Sometimes
he paints interiors&mdash;people are playing at cards, or having a
family concert, or reading, or drinking, or conversing. Sometimes
he paints exteriors; then the painter introduces us to domestic
occupations, and the innocent recreations of private life,
as, for instance, a servant washing linen in a back yard, or cleaning
fish, or plucking a fowl; or perhaps there are ladies and
their cavaliers playing at bowls in a garden with trim gravelled
walks."</p>

<p><b>His Excellent Painting of Interiors.</b>&mdash;"When he paints interiors,
this artist rarely neglects to show, on the right or left,
doors opening on a staircase or revealing a leafy alley, or the
trees along a quay, so that his pictures almost always seem to
be the antechamber of another picture. In this characteristic
style of De Hooch, when the interior of the apartment is moderately
lighted, the sun shines outside, and we feel its heat and
brilliance in the vistas gradually lost to view in the background,
so inimitably managed in the artist's manner.... Pieter de Hooch
seems to have been in Rembrandt's secrets, and knew how to
adapt the genius of that great master to familiar scenes, just as
Gonzales Coques had adapted the genius of Rubens."</p></div>

<p><b>Seven Fine Examples of his Work in the Rijks.</b>&mdash;The
Rijks Museum owns seven fine examples of this master's
work. The Portrait of a Man is said to be that of the
painter at the age of nineteen; but this is doubtful. One
of the most celebrated interiors shows a woman about to let
a child drink from a jug of beer at the entrance to a cellar.
This picture is very attractive for the simple attitudes, and
for the depth of the equally sustained warm harmony. "The
execution," says Crowe, "is a model of softness and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'juciness'">juiciness</ins>."
The most glowing example, however, of this warm
lighting is a woman cleaning the hair of a child, in the Van der<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Hoop Room. The woman wears a skirt of deep blue and a
bodice of red, bordered with white fur, while the child has a
skirt of green and a gray bodice. Behind them is an alcove
bed with green curtains, and to the right, in the foreground,
a little chair. An open door on the left allows you to see
into another room with a passage and courtyard beyond. A
little black dog seen from behind lies on the reddish tiles.
The picture is beautiful in its treatment of three successive
planes of light.</p>

<span class="caption">P. DE HOOCH<br />

</div>

<p>Another picture in the same collection represents apparently
a pair of lovers who seem to be teasing each other.
The lady seen in profile is squeezing a lemon into a glass,
and the young man sitting opposite with his elbow on the
table looks at her with a subtle smile. The costumes are
elegant&mdash;the lady wears a straw-colored skirt and a rose-colored
jacket. The man has on a garnet-colored doublet,
scarlet knee-breeches, and white stockings. He is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'bare-headed' and 'bareheaded' were used in this text. This was retained.">bareheaded</ins>
and wears a wig. If it were not for the pipe in his
hand he would remind you of Moli&egrave;re's gentlemen. They
are sitting in a kind of courtyard of a house with a red-tiled
roof, and a window with red shutters is also visible.
At the door of the house a woman is standing with a glass in
her hand. A servant is busy with a kettle by the window.
On the right there is an opening into a clump of trees, suggesting
a park, and to the left another enclosure.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful pictures in the collection, a
marvel very difficult to describe because its superlative
value lies in its luminous effect, is thus described:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>A Picture Highly valued for its Luminous Effect.</b>&mdash;"We
are in a room, the door of which, in the background on the left,
opens onto the quay of a canal. A girl passes along the path;
next we see a tree, a stretch of the canal, and on the opposite
bank another street, flooded with sunlight, in which two cloaked
men have halted in front of a house. Above the door, which is
slightly arched, is a large window with small panes in four compartments,
one of which is open. Under the light falling from
the window, in the corner of the room, a girl in a blue bodice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and white apron is seated, with her head turned toward a youth
who is entering through on the extreme right in the foreground.
In one hand he holds his hat, and presents a letter with the
other."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></div>

<p><b>A Pleasing Sunlight Effect.</b>&mdash;Another picture shows a
sunlight effect, in which both De Hooch and Vermeer of
Delft delighted. There is a window on the left, above a
table covered with a Turkey-red <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'table-cloth' and 'tablecloth' were used in this text. This was retained.">table-cloth</ins>, which is silhouetted
brightly on the lower part of the opposite wall,
close to a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'chimney-piece' and 'chimney piece' were used in this text. This was retained.">chimney piece</ins>. A servant is sweeping in front
of the latter. Another woman, almost full-face, is seated,
holding a baby in a yellow frock, with a child's cradle beside
her. She wears a blue velvet jacket and red skirt.
Behind her a door opens into a courtyard, and gives us a
glimpse of the town. The rest of the background consists
of a gray wall, on which hangs a picture. There is also a
picture over the fireplace.</p>

<p><b>The Sick Lady.</b>&mdash;Very similar to the pictures by Jan
Steen and Metsu is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Hoogstraten,' 'Hoogstraaten,' and 'Hooghstraten' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hooghstraten</ins>'s The Sick Lady, who,
very pale and with drooping head, sits by a table on which
her left elbow rests. On the red cloth, which is covered
with a piece of white linen, stand a pot and a phial. She
wears a white cap, a yellow jacket bordered with ermine, a
Persian-blue skirt, and a white apron. Her hands are
clasped at her waist, and her feet rest on a foot-warmer.
Behind the table stands the doctor in his conventional costume
of black. The bed, draped with green curtains, is
seen in the background, where, to the left, a short flight of
stairs leads to a series of rooms opening one into another
in the style of Pieter de Hooch. The figures, about a foot
high, are very finely drawn. Burger says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The general harmony of color is strange, distinguished, and
original. There are tones of straw-color, tones of pearl-color,
and silvery tones, happily brought together, a clever distribution
of light, and lightness in the shadows."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Jan Steen's Style patterned after Hals and A. van
Ostade.</b>&mdash;Jan Steen shows the influence of his models,
Hals and Adriaen van Ostade, in several of the seventeen
pictures of this artist owned by the Rijks Museum. His
own portrait and those in the Oostwaard picture (dated
1659) are strong, bright, and clear with the qualities he
admired in Hals. The other pictures are all distinguished
by correct drawing, admirable freedom and spirit of touch,
and clear and transparent color. They range in subject
from the stately interiors of grave and opulent burghers to
tavern scenes of jollity and debauch.</p>

<p><b>Some of the Seventeen of his Pictures owned by the
Rijks.</b>&mdash;There are two pictures of the charlatan who puffs
his pills, draws teeth, and sells everything helpful to those
sick in body or in mind, from a love-philtre to the Elixir
of Life. Here, also, we see doctors and patients, card-parties,
marriage-feasts, and the festivals of St. Nicholas
and Twelfth Night. His delightful rendering of children
is also fully exemplified here. In detail, the pictures are
as follows: A Portrait of Himself, showing a rather handsome
man with oval face, arched brows, and well-cut
mouth; A Charlatan Selling his Wares, in which the chief
figure is standing on a platform beneath the shade of a
tree, while around him are many little figures variously
grouped, forming comic episodes; The Baker Oostwaard
with his Wife and a Son of the Painter (1659). The baker
is arranging his wares, and the little boy is blowing on a
horn. The Scullion represents a woman scouring a pewter
pot. She is in a kitchen, and wears a white jacket and a
blue skirt. On the table by which she stands are utensils
and a lantern.</p>

The Parrot Cage</span>
</div>

<p><b>Description of The Parrot Cage.</b>&mdash;The Parrot Cage
is a domestic scene, in what appears to be a tavern or a
middle-class hall, in which there is a bed, a chair, and a
table, at which two men are playing backgammon, while
a third looks on smoking a pipe. At the big fireplace an
old woman is broiling oysters, which are likely to spoil, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
she is taking more interest in the backgammon than in her
own task. A boy seated on a low stool is feeding a kitten
with milk from a spoon, and watching a woman of graceful
figure who is offering a biscuit to a parrot in a cage.</p>

<p>The Orgy is famous for the dash and abandon with which
it is painted.</p>

<p><b>The Village Wedding and Other Pictures.</b>&mdash;The Rijks
owns also The Birthday of the Prince of Orange, The
Happy Return, The Rake, The Dancing Lesson, in which
merry children are teaching a cat to dance; The Village
Wedding, a little masterpiece, in which the light is treated
as if by Ostade, and where the bride and groom are seated
at a table with friends, while musicians play for many
dancers.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Happy Family.</b>&mdash;In The Happy
Family we see a simply furnished room, in which is a bed,
and next it a cupboard, on the top of which stand a mortar,
some platters, and a vase of flowers; a happy family group
is seated at a table. Hanging on the bed curtains is the
legend in Dutch, "As the old ones sing so will the young
ones pipe." This is the keynote of the picture. Every one
is singing, piping, and making merry. Their gaiety is infectious.
The father, seated at the end of the table, has a
viola in one hand, while the right holds a glass of wine.
Next him stands a boy playing bagpipes. Then the grandmother,
singing, with a jolly expression on her face; next,
the merry mother, with a merry baby, the image of her;
next, a boy with a flute, another with a pipe; next, a girl
about to smoke a pipe, in front two children, and at the
open window a boy with a pipe. A dog stands by the
master, near an empty platter, that shows he too has shared
in the feast. There is a handsome table-carpet on the
table, protected by a napkin, and on it a ham and a loaf
of bread.</p>

</div>

<p><b>A Family Scene on Twelfth Night.</b>&mdash;Nearly all the
same persons, only grown older, appear in A Family Scene
on Twelfth Night: <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Marguerite' and 'Margarita' van Goyen were used in this text. This was retained.">Margarita</ins> van Goyen, Steen's wife, seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
this time from behind, with her profile upturned, and wearing
a red skirt and a blue jacket trimmed with ermine, and
ten other figures, including the old father and the painter
himself, who are smoking in the background. "Delicious
in color and vivacity!" is Burger's comment.</p>

<p><b>A Doubtful Picture of Steen and his Wife.</b>&mdash;The
Couple Drinking is said to be Steen and his wife. The
latter with a white handkerchief on her head, a dark blue
jacket, red skirt, and white apron is drinking from a tall
glass. The man in black behind her and talking to her is
about to drink from a mug. The ages of the couple make
it doubtful if the painter and his wife are represented.</p>

<p><b>The Young Lady who is Ill.</b>&mdash;The Young Lady who is
Ill, seated languidly in a red arm-chair, with her head on
a pillow, may be compared with similar pictures in The
Hague Gallery. She wears a yellow silk skirt, and a jacket
of lilac velvet bordered with ermine. The doctor is one of
Steen's best creations of this type.</p>

<p><b>Steen's Most Popular Picture.</b>&mdash;The most popular of all
Steen's pictures, however, is the Eve of St. Nicholas, which
shows a room in Jan Steen's house, and himself, his first
wife, and their children. Beside the chimney sits the mother
in lilac skirt and green velvet jacket bordered with ermine,
and on her left is a low table, on which is a variety of cakes,
fruits, and other holiday sweets. In the background sits
the father, who is enjoying the scene. Seven children are
present. The oldest, holding a baby with a rag doll in its
arms, is pointing up the chimney, explaining to the open-mouthed
and staring little boy at his side whence St. Nicholas
came. On the extreme left a boy is crying because all
that St. Nicholas has rewarded him with is a birch rod,
which his sister is presenting to him in his wooden shoe, and
with evident pleasure. A little boy, with his father's cane in
his hand, is enjoying his brother's disappointment and probable
future punishment. In the background, the grandmother,
drawing the curtains of the bed and tauntingly
beckoning to the crying boy, seems to invite him to spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
his St. Nicholas festival in bed. In the very centre of the
picture is the pet of the family&mdash;a little girl, the very image
of her mother. She has a pail full of toys, fruits, and cakes
on one arm, and in her tiny hands she holds the figure of
St. Nicholas, whose head is surrounded with a nimbus.</p>

<p>A basket of wafers, cakes, waffles, buns, crullers, etc., stands
on the floor on the left; and leaning against the little table on
the right is an enormous flat loaf of bread or cake iced in lines
and decorated with figures of the cock at the four corners
and in the centre that of St. Nicholas.</p>

<p><b>Early and Later Styles of Jan Miense Molenaer.</b>&mdash;Jan
Miense Molenaer (1610-68) was either a pupil or a very
skilful imitator of Jan Steen in his early works, which are
painted in strong, clear color with bold execution. About
1650, however, he adopted a brown tone with a light and
transparent execution, and concentrated his effects of light
after the manner of Ostade when the latter was under the
influence of Rembrandt.</p>

<p><b>A Fine Example of his Powers.</b>&mdash;The Lady at the Clavecin
is a splendid example of the powers of this artist who was
almost as fond of making musical instruments important
features of his compositions as <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Slingelandt' and 'Slingerlandt' were used in this text. This was retained.">Slingelandt</ins> was. It was
painted in 1637 as the signature shows, and therefore is full
of the Hals influence. The lady and two children, whose
amiable faces are turned with interested expression toward
the spectator, are evidently portraits, probably of the artist's
wife and children. The other picture, Grace before Meat,
is also a fine study with Hals's technique. It is in the Van
der Hoop Collection.</p>

<p><b>Four Pictures by Metsu.</b>&mdash;Four Metsus hang in the
Rijks: The Huntsman's Present, purchased in 1843 for
12,400 florins, The Old Drinker, purchased in 1827 for
2,960 florins, The Breakfast, acquired in 1809, and the
Old Woman in Meditation, bought in 1880 for 6,170 florins.</p>

<p><b>Description of The Huntsman's Present.</b>&mdash;For taste,
depth, warm harmony, and careful execution, The Huntsman's
Present is of the first order. In a room lighted by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
window on the left, a lady is seated by the side of a table on
which is a rich carpet. A large white apron of exquisite
tone covers her lap, and on it lies a little green cushion on
which she has been making lace, which she holds in her left
hand. Her jacket, bordered with ermine, is of that flesh-color
that Metsu loved. With her right hand she caresses
a little King Charles spaniel perched on the table. On her
right, an old gentleman is seated. He still wears his hunting
clothes and holds his hat under his arm. Evidently he has
just returned from the chase, for his dog is with him, and
on the floor lie his game bag, gun, and a dead duck. To
the lady he is presenting a partridge. On a handsome <i>kas</i>
stands a statuette of Cupid.</p>

<p><b>The Old Drinker.</b>&mdash;The Old Drinker represents a man
with gray hair and short gray beard, with a pipe in one hand
and a mug in the other. He has on a gray coat and a red
cap edged with brown fur. He is perfectly happy, as his
joyous expression shows.</p>

<p><b>The Breakfast.</b>&mdash;The Breakfast is a beautifully painted
scene. At a table covered with a Persian carpet over which
is thrown a linen cloth, a woman in a light pink bodice, a
violet skirt, green apron, and white fichu, seated at the right
in profile, is pouring wine from a jug into a tall glass. A
man in a puce-colored vest is placing a dish of meat on the
table, which is already set with plates, bread, knives, and a
glass. On the left is a dark green curtain, and in the background
a door is indicated.</p>

<p><b>Johannes Verkolje.</b>&mdash;Johannes Verkolje (1650-93) is represented
by The Family Concert (1673). He was the
son of a locksmith in Amsterdam, and studied with Jan
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Lievens' and 'Lievensz' were used in this text. This was retained.">Lievensz</ins>, but later imitated the highly finished style of Gerard
Pietersz Zijl (fl. 1655), whose works were in such favor.
He produced portraits, historical subjects, and conversations,
delicate and graceful in sentiment, charming in color,
and excellent in drawing.</p>

<p><b>Jan Victors's Pork Butcher.</b>&mdash;The Pork Butcher (1648)
and The Dentist (1654) are by Jan Victors, an artist about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
whom so little has been known until recent years that he has
been confused with two others of the same name. The
pork butcher is seen in the centre of the picture, which represents
a village street; the butcher is standing before his
freshly butchered quarter of pork, and a boy, in a large hat
and jacket, with yellow sleeves, with knife in hand, is helping
his master, to whom a woman is bringing a drink in a
glass. On the right, a little boy seated on a fence is blowing
a bladder, while a little girl looks on and laughs. Behind, a
man is ascending a ladder into a barn. On the right a little
boy is washing a ham in a tub, and a woman is kneeling by
him with a dish.</p>

<p><b>The Dentist.</b>&mdash;The pendant shows a table over which a
rose-colored umbrella is opened, and under it a charlatan is
drawing the tooth of a peasant. A man and a woman witness
the operation, and three children on the left, a peasant,
and a woman with some vegetables on her head are laughing
heartily. In the foreground two dogs are quarrelling over a
bone; and in the background small figures and a village
clock-tower are visible.</p>

<p><b>The Religious Pictures.</b>&mdash;The religious pictures need not
detain us long. Two or three in the style of Rembrandt:
Isaac Blessing Jacob, by Govert Flinck; The Woman Taken
in Adultery, by G. van der Eckhout, purchased in London
in 1828 for 3,000 florins, and belonging to that artist's best
period; and the picture of Herodias with the Head of John
the Baptist are worth the student's attention. The latter is
particularly interesting, because, although the catalogues
give it to Cornelis Drost (1638-?), a pupil and imitator of
Rembrandt, it is really by the hand of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Carel Fabritius' and 'Karel Fabricius' (or vice versa) were used in this text. This was retained.">Karel Fabritius</ins>
(1624?-54), also a pupil of Rembrandt and so close a
follower that many of his pictures have passed for Rembrandt's.
The artist met with a tragic death; for he was
killed in Delft by the explosion of a powder magazine.</p>

<p><b>Aertsen's Altarpieces.</b>&mdash;Of historic value are the altar
wings by Pieter Aertsen (Long Peter), The Presentation at
the Temple; on the reverse, King Balthasar, painted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the Delft church; and the Nativity of Jesus Christ, a fragment
of a picture destroyed in the fire of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'town-hall' and 'town hall' were used in this text. This was retained.">Town Hall</ins> in
Amsterdam in 1652. On Dr. J. Six's authority, the rest
of this picture is in the New Church in Amsterdam.
Aertsen was particularly famous for his altarpieces, many
of which were destroyed by the Iconoclasts in 1566.</p>

<p><b>Other Painters of Biblical Scenes.</b>&mdash;Of other painters
whose reputations are larger in other fields, but who are
represented in this gallery by one or two Biblical works,
we may mention Berchem, with Ruth and Boaz; Velvet
Brueghel, Repose of the Holy Family, Christ Preaching in
a Fisherman's Boat, and the Adoration of the Kings, in a
winter landscape; Frans Francken II., Adoration of Jesus
Christ, and The Prodigal Son; and Maerten van Heemskerck
(1498-1574), The Resurrection of Christ. Benjamin
Gerritsz Cuijp may be studied in Joseph Interpreting
the Dreams of the Baker and Butler; Dirck van <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Hoogstraten,' 'Hoogstraaten,' and 'Hooghstraten' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hoogstraten</ins>

<p>In addition to several Biblical pictures in the Italian,
Flemish, and German schools, there are, by Fran&ccedil;ois Joseph
Navez (1787-1839), Isaac and Rebecca and the Resurrection
of the Widow's Son; by A. van Dijck, The Repentant

<p><b>Mythological Pictures combined with Landscape.</b>&mdash;It
is noticeable that in mythological pictures landscape forms
a prominent feature. Rubens was, doubtless, responsible
for much of the popularity of this class of art, and the vogue
that the Italian landscape also enjoyed aided the taste.
Nymphs and satyrs and gods and goddesses were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
appropriate figures to introduce into the classic scenes of
Italy than Dutch peasants and cattle. We, therefore, find
two classes of mythological pictures: one in which the
landscape is more important than the figures; and one in
which the figures take precedence.</p>

<p>Born more than half a century after Poelenburg, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'G&eacute;rard' and 'Gerard' de Lairesse were used in this text. This was retained.">Gerard</ins>
de Lairesse (1641-1711), the most important Flemish
painter of historical and mythological subjects in the generation
succeeding Rubens, followed Poelenburg in his
taste for Italian settings for his figures, although he had
never been to Italy. He is represented in the Rijks by
Mars, Venus, and Cupid; another of the same title, Seleucus
Abdicating in Favor of his Son Antiochus; Diana and
Endymion; Virtue, an Allegory; and two in <i>grisaille</i>,&mdash;The
Revolution and Legitimate Power.</p>

<p><b>G. de Lairesse, Portrait-painter.</b>&mdash;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'G&eacute;rard' and 'Gerard' de Lairesse were used in this text. This was retained.">Gerard</ins> de Lairesse
was the son of an artist of some celebrity, studied
under Bertholet Flemalle, and by the age of sixteen had
become known as a portrait-painter. Some historical works
for the Electors of Cologne and Brandenburg established
his reputation, and when he settled in Amsterdam he was
regarded as the greatest historical painter of his time. At
the age of fifty he lost his eyesight. His style is grand and
poetical, and his background enriched with architecture.</p>

<p><b>More Mythological Pictures in the Rijks.</b>&mdash;The other
mythological pictures in this gallery are: Hendrick van
Balen (1575-1632), Bacchus's Homage to Diana; Jan
Brueghel le Vieux (Velvet) (1568-1625), Latona in Caria;
Caravaggio (1569-1609), The Death of Orion; Johannes

by the name of Narcissus.</p>

<p><b>Painters of Exteriors and Painters of Interiors.</b>&mdash;No survey
of Dutch art would be complete without a brief account
of the painters of buildings; and these may be divided
again into two classes: those who painted the exteriors and
those who painted the interiors.</p>

<p><b>Murant and his Old <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'farm-house' and 'farmhouse' were used in this text. This was retained.">Farm-house</ins>.</b>&mdash;The first of those
who painted exteriors seems to have been Emanuel Murant
(1622-1700), a pupil of Philips <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>. He chose
for his specialty Dutch village houses which he painted with
vigor and warmth, and introduced figures and cattle into
his foregrounds. These he painted himself. His works
are rare, because he spent so much time on each work that
he produced few pictures. He also spent much time in
travel. His color is rich and silvery in tone; his impasto
fine, and he gives the details with great truth and finish.
By the aid of a magnifying-glass every stone in his buildings
and every leaf on his trees may be counted. The Rijks
possesses The Old Farm-house, which represents a dilapidated
old house, where a man is feeding the chickens, and
there are also pigs and an old woman at her spinning-wheel.</p>

<p><b>Jan <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van der Heyden,' 'Van der Heyde,' and 'Venderheydene' were used in this text. This was retained.">van der Heyden</ins>.</b>&mdash;Jan van der Heyden (1637-1712)
was "the Gerard Dou of architectural painters." The
Rijks owns View of the Town of Amersfoort, with delightful
figures by A. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van der Velde</ins>, A Drawbridge, A Stone

bordered with trees. His tone is warm, and his execution
soft and free.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p><b>G. A. Berck-Heyde, Painter of German and Dutch
Towns.</b>&mdash;Another skilful painter of exteriors, Gerrit Adriaensz
Berck-Heyde (1638-98), is noted for his faithful

<p><b>Painters of Interiors&mdash;P. H. van Steenwyck.</b>&mdash;Turning
now to those painters who devoted their attention chiefly to
interiors, the first to be noticed is Pieter Hendrik van
Steenwyck the Elder (1550-about 1604), the pupil of Jan
Vredeman de Vries, who has never been surpassed in this
particular field. He usually painted the interiors of Gothic
churches and other buildings. He also won distinction
with torchlight effects. The figures were usually supplied
by the Franckens and others. Van Steenwyck lived in
Antwerp and also in Frankfort. The Interior of a Catholic
Church, in the Rijks, is a good example of his style.</p>

<p><b>His Pupil, Pieter Neeffs the Elder.</b>&mdash;Among his pupils
was Pieter Neeffs the Elder (1577-between 1657-61),
who followed his master closely, but with a heavy touch.
His colors are not so pleasing as Steenwyck's, but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
mechanical skill is great. F. Francken, Teniers, Velvet
Brueghel, and Van Thulden are responsible for the figures in
his pictures. In the Rijks we may study him by his Church
of the Dominicans in Antwerp (1636), A Church: Effect
of Candle-light (1636), and Interior of a Church.</p>

<p><b>P. J. Saenredam, Painter of Church Interiors.</b>&mdash;Next
must be mentioned Pieter Jansz Saenredam (1597-1665),
who painted the interior of churches in a large and luminous
manner. His pictures were highly esteemed, but
are now very rare. The Rijks owns: two Interiors of the
Church of St. Bavon, Haarlem; three Interiors of St. Mary's,
Utrecht; and View of the Church in Assendelft. Adriaen
van Ostade contributed the figures in the latter. Pieter
Saenredam was a pupil of his father, a celebrated engraver,
and of Frans de Grebber in Haarlem.</p>

<p><b>Emanuel de Witte's Beautiful Work.</b>&mdash;Emanuel de
Witte (1617-92), a pupil of Evert van Aelst, bears the
same relation to the representation of interiors that <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>
does to landscape, and Willem <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins> to marine
painting. Beautiful modelling, fine color, linear and a&euml;rial
perspective, masterly treatment of chiaroscuro, and animated
figures are all at his command. The Vestibule in the Prinsenhof
in Delft and two Interiors of a Church are picturesque
canvases that exhibit the rich talents of this painter.</p>

<p><b>H. C. van Vliet.</b>&mdash;Hendrik Cornelisz van Vliet (1608-66?),
a pupil of his father, Willem van Vliet (1584-1642),
paints under the influence of De Witte as is shown
in the Interior of Part of the Old Church at Delft, signed "H.
van Vliet, 1654." Here the treatment of sunlight is very
reminiscent of Emanuel de Witte.</p>

<p><b>Egbert van der Poel.</b>&mdash;In this connection may be mentioned
Egbert van der Poel (1621-64), whose specialty
was conflagrations. The effects of lurid light are seen in
his Ruins in Delft after the Explosion of a Powder Magazine
(1654) and Interior of a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'farm-house' and 'farmhouse' were used in this text. This was retained.">Farm-house</ins> (1646).</p>

<p><b>Collections on the Ground-floor and Basement.</b>&mdash;After
lunching in the pleasant little restaurant in the west wing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
on the ground-floor we take a rapid view of the collections
here. The East and West Courts contain military, naval,
and colonial collections, weapons, uniforms, and models of
ships, which need not detain us long; nor will the department
of Ecclesiastical Architecture and the Hall of the
Admirals, where there is a collection of modern French
paintings. In the western half of the building there are
splendid collections of engravings, porcelain, lacquer, and
textiles, two seventeenth century rooms furnished by the
Antiquarian Society, and in the basement a collection of
old Dutch costumes, carriages, and doll houses. On the
east side are a number of correctly furnished Dutch rooms,
one a "Chinese Boudoir" from the Stadtholder's Palace at
Leeuwarden (seventeenth century), and a great collection
of civic and industrial domestic art. Silver occupies a
conspicuous place, and one of the cases contains drinking-horns,
among which is the original drinking-horn of the
Guild of St. Joris, which appears in Van der Helst's
painting.</p>

<p>The visitor will seldom see a more wonderful collection
of glass of all shapes and forms, and beautifully engraved,
cut, and mounted; and the display of jewelry, trinkets,
and children's toys will also claim attention.</p>

<p><b>The Garden.</b>&mdash;We now enter the garden at the south
side of the building. This is laid out in the Dutch style
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with clipped
hedges of beech and box, and adorned with flowers, vases,
statues, and busts. There is also a maze, and fragments
of old Dutch buildings, such as the old Bergpoort of
Deventer (1619) and the Heerenpoort of Groningen
(1621). Various old gables, pilasters, columns, walls,
tympanums, and gates have been grouped; and in the
eastern part of the garden is the house of the Director of
the Museum.

<h2>THE STEDELIJK MUSEUM</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Ground-floor of the Stedelijk Museum.</b>&mdash;A short walk
from the Rijks down Paulus Potter Straat brings us to the
Stedelijk (Municipal) Museum, built in 1892-95. The
ground-floor is devoted to uniforms, weapons, and pictures
of the Schutterij of Amsterdam, and a series of rooms furnished
in the style of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
centuries, including an old Dutch kitchen.</p>

<p><b>Its Pictures of the History of the Netherlands.</b>&mdash;An
extraordinary collection of pictures by Alleb&eacute;, Isra&euml;ls,
Rochussen, and other well-known painters, treating of the
history of the Netherlands, deserves a passing glance, for
there are no less than 250 small canvases, all of the same
dimensions and similar treatment. A more curiously monotonous
effect would be impossible to imagine; but, to use
a Dutch term, they are decidedly <i>symmetrisch</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Gallery of Modern Pictures.</b>&mdash;Ascending the stairs
we reach the gallery of modern pictures. The collection
consists of about 200 paintings gathered by a society
founded in 1874, and is very rich in fine examples of the
modern Dutch school.</p>

<p><b>Mauve's Sheep on the Dunes.</b>&mdash;One of the gems of
the modern landscapes is Mauve's Sheep on the Dunes.
The sheep, all of which have their backs to the spectator,
the rolling dunes with their tall, waving grass, the shepherd
boy and his dog, are all painted with equal skill; and over
the still landscape hovers a poetic feeling that communicates
itself instantly to the spectator.</p>

<p>Mauve is also represented by A Fold and Woodmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Anton Mauve.</b>&mdash;Anton Mauve (1838-89) was a native
of Zaandam, and the son of a clergyman. He studied
under the cattle-painter, Van Os, who was not particularly
pleased with his pupil. After his apprenticeship was over,
he began to paint little pictures in the neat manner and
conventional style of his master. Mauve lived in Oosterbeck,
"the Barbison of Holland," for a time, and at a later
period spent his winters in Amsterdam and his summers in
The Hague, where he could enjoy Scheveningen and the
dunes.</p>

<p>A Dutch writer, A. C. Loffelt, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>His Style.</b>&mdash;"The poetry of Mauve's art, its tenderness,
the unobtrusive, quiet sadness of the scenery and people which
attracted him most; the homeliness, humor, and domestic happiness
which he interpreted in his interiors and scenes of country
and village life, can only be appreciated by people of the
same descent."</p></div>

<p>The same critic tells us that Mauve lived for a time in a
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'farm-house' and 'farmhouse' were used in this text. This was retained.">farm-house</ins>, near Dekkersdinn.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>His Favorite Themes.</b>&mdash;"Here Mauve found some of his
most important and favorite themes, such as poor cots built in
or near the downs, where slender, poorly nurtured women tended
a few sheep or a goat, or occupied themselves in bleaching
linen. His painting had not yet gained that transparency and
brilliancy of tone which the artist acquired in subsequent years.
At this time his work was gray, but not always pellucid or silvery.
Thus it came to pass that critics and public began to
talk of 'The Gray School,' for a few other artists painted in the
same neutral scale of tints.</p>

<p>"As we walk in the rural lanes, beneath the slender birches
wrapped in their mantle of silver-gray haze, or watch the
chequered sunlight dancing into the secluded nooks of some
emerald meadow, when we hear the echoes of the tinkling
sheep-bells on the moors, we think 'There lives Mauve!'"</p></div>

<p><b>His Truthful Painting of Sheep and Cattle.</b>&mdash;Mauve is,
perhaps, best known by his flocks of sheep painted under
all conditions and at all seasons and times of day; but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
less true to nature are his cows in the <i>Melkbocht</i>, that paddock
or reserved spot in the meadow where the cows are
gathered for milking. His horses ploughing, or at rest, and
his coast scenes, showing Dutch fishing-boats about to be
pulled across the sands by teams of horses, are no less
remarkable performances.</p>

<p><b>The Early Training of Josef Isra&euml;ls.</b>&mdash;For a whole generation
Josef Isra&euml;ls has stood at the head of modern Dutch
art. Born in 1827, at Groningen, the son of a money-changer,
he carried money-bags in his early years to the
banking-house of Mesdag. He studied under Jan Adam
Kruseman, and at first painted historical pictures; lived in
the Ghetto in Amsterdam, and nearly starved in Paris, where
he studied in the Delaroche school.</p>

<p><b>The Themes of his Paintings.</b>&mdash;It was in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Zantvoort'">Zandvoort</ins>,
near Haarlem, that he discovered his true bent, and began
to depict the seafaring man and the peasant in their homely
every-day life. His people are all humble, and most of them
are broken by poverty and sorrows. For more than thirty
years his pictures have occupied the place of honor in all
the Dutch exhibitions; and on his seventieth birthday he
was made Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau, and
was the recipient of many gifts and congratulations. In
this gallery hang a number of pictures dating from various
periods. Among them are Fisherman's Children, Rustic
Interior, After the Storm, Passing the Mother's Grave,
Margaret of Parma and William of Orange (one of his
earliest efforts), Old Jewish Peddler, and a Study of a
Head.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Veth's Appreciation of Isra&euml;ls.</b>&mdash;The artist himself is
represented in a statuette by F. Leenhoff, which stands in
one of the rooms, and also in a portrait by J. Veth, who
sympathetically writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The choicest pictures by this master are painted in a truly
mysterious way, simply by the nervous vigor of an untaught hand
with heavy, sweeping shadows and thick touches of paint, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
stand out in a wonderful mixture of sharp relief and dim, confused
distance; with soft hesitation and touches of crudely decisive
certainty; with broad outlines and incisive emphasis.
Ruggedness and tenderness, corruption and sweetness, whimsicality
and decision, are magically mingled there in dignified
depth, with the most refined feeling&mdash;the most ductile language
of the brush that is known to me.</p>

<p>"And yet, notwithstanding, all this exists, as far as possible,
in the clear, simple execution of the old Dutch painters, and
there is one great family resemblance between the nineteenth
century master and those who are the classics among the <i>petits
ma&icirc;tres</i>."</p>

<p><b>Each of his Pictures a Harmonious Whole.</b>&mdash;"The resemblance&mdash;the
revived tradition&mdash;is to be seen in the fact that
Isra&euml;ls, like the old Dutch painters, nay, even more than they,
always aims at the sober, general harmony of the whole work.
It is wonderful how discreet the effect is of a picture, for instance,
by Pieter de Hooch, with all its elaborate execution;
how splendidly it holds together, how strong yet delicate the
construction is. It is this great quality of presenting an absolutely
organic whole at one impulse which seems to have passed into
Isra&euml;ls from his precursors, who otherwise painted so utterly
differently. Indeed, it is in this concentrated power, in this
self-contained harmony, the outcome of one glance, as it were,
and of one impetus, that we may discern one of the principal
features of Isra&euml;ls's art. There is nothing in his work that asserts
itself alone, nothing detached, nothing that plays any part but
that of strengthening the whole."</p>

<p><b>His Aim to paint the Truth, rather than to produce
Studied Effects.</b>&mdash;"Those who really understand the sincerity
of his art know that he rejects everything approaching to working
for effect&mdash;everything that looks like rule of thumb; and
that he in fact never consciously troubles his head about studied
effects or beauty. Beauty to him lies in the silent woe with
which the survivors stand in a house of death; in the attitude
of the old wife left alone, who spreads her hands stiffly out to
the fire, as though she might win a spark of life from the
smouldering hearth; in the way in which the decrepit old man
sits with resigned dejection in his gloomy hovel, staring into his
old dog's eyes; in the stupefied wretch who sits on a broken
bench, where, behind him, his dead wife lies stretched on her
bed; in the woful gleam in the eyes of the huckster who sits in
front of his dirty booth, with a motley collection of rags above
his head, watching us so mysteriously; in the sad old woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
who, with elbows wide apart on her table, her hands quietly
folded, sits weary and alone in front of her meal; in the kindly
but hard-set woman, who, through wind and weather, tramps
along field and road by her jolting dog-barrow, in a cruel struggle
for existence; in the business of the fisherman and seafaring
folk and their hard and simple labor; in the dignity of the
patriarchal peasant family that gathers round the dish; he sees
beauty in everything which lays bare what lies mysteriously
latent in poverty and privation and suffering, at the very roots
of human life."</p></div>

<p><b>Roelofs, Painter of A Marshy Landscape.</b>&mdash;Familiar
to the Holland traveller is the Marshy Landscape, so true

<p>This painter was born in Amsterdam and was a pupil of
H. van de Sande Bakhuijzen for about a year; then he remained
for six years in Utrecht; and settled in Brussels,
where he remained forty years, finally returning to Holland.
This painter's chief desire is to express himself poetically.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>The Inexhaustible Supply of His Favorite Subjects.</b>&mdash;"His
pictures are truly beautiful: cattle standing up to their
knees in rich green pasture land; luxuriant meadows; secluded
pools reflecting the blue sky and the moving clouds; lakes with
floating lilies; rivers, streams, noble trees, canals, and the
thoroughly Dutch windmill. Roelofs may be called the pioneer
in our country of a broader school of painting, especially that
pertaining to landscape. Much of this he may be said to have
taken from the French.... Of late years he has added more
cattle to his pictures; but whether cattle or trees, land or water,
they are painted with the firm belief that they needed no embellishment,
but were good enough to be represented exactly as
they were. For Roelofs will not invent a subject. And why,
indeed, should he do so? Is the supply exhausted? <i>He</i> does
not think so, for no summer passes but he packs up his paint-box
and with his little stool, his easel, and his umbrella, goes
off either to Noorden, or Abcoude, or to Voorschoten, to study
nature again and again, as if he did not know her well already."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></div>

<p><b>J. Maris, Skilful in producing Ethereal Effects.</b>&mdash;Of
Jacob Maris, Zilcken writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"No painter has so well expressed the ethereal effects, bathed
in air and light, through floating silvery mist, in which painters
delight, and the characteristic remote horizons blurred by haze;
or again the gray yet luminous weather of Holland, unlike the
dead gray rain of England, or the heavy sky of Paris."</p></div>

<p>This artist may be studied in this gallery by A Beach,
two Views of a Town, The Ferry, and The Two Windmills,
which latter represents two windmills standing as sentinels
over a rather dreary landscape at the edge of a river and a
canal.</p>

<p><b>His Training and his Aim in Art.</b>&mdash;Jacob Maris (1837-99)
was born in The Hague and was sent to Stroebel's
studio, and later studied in the Antwerp Academy of Drawing.
He was also a pupil of Louis Meyer in The Hague, and in
1865 went to Paris and studied with H&eacute;bert. Returning to
The Hague, he devoted himself to landscape. He painted
views of streets, country lanes, small hamlets, windmills,
canals, rivers, and, sometimes, <i>genre</i> pieces. In all his
work his aim was to make an impression. One day he
said: "A picture is finished as soon as you can see what it
is intended to represent."</p>

<p><b>Marius on the Beauty of his Work.</b>&mdash;The Dutch critic,
G. H. Marius, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If you stand before one of Maris's pictures for a long time
you discover many objects which you had not noticed at first&mdash;houses,
bridges, trees, all looming out of the mellow misty light
which is diffused over the entire canvas.... What an endless
variety of windmills he immortalizes! Some of his canvases
have but a small solitary windmill, while others have a crowd of
these gigantic, cumbersome structures. Some pictures have a
fringe of them upon the horizon.</p>

<p>"However simple the subject, it is ofttimes made almost
dramatic by the rays of the setting sun, or by the brilliancy of a
silver-lined cloud. These effects of light and shade are rapidly
passing, and we gaze with admiration upon the skilful work of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
man who can produce such a faithful picture, which his eye
could have seen but momentarily. Sometimes he paints a canal
with a barge pulled by a weary-looking horse, tramping along
the muddy road the ruts of which are filled with water from
recent rain (his horses are generally white). Or it is a bit of
rich agricultural land, the long furrows stretching into the far
distance; against a wonderful sky you see the profiles of distant
houses, trees, mills, etc., all dying away into the horizon, showing
the flatness of our Dutch landscape, where there is nothing
to impede or obstruct the eye for miles."</p></div>

<p><b>Willem Maris's Relish for painting Cows.</b>&mdash;Willem Maris
(1844- ) studied with his brothers Jacob and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Matthys' and 'Thys' Maris were used in this text. This was retained.">Matthys</ins>,
and all three worked together. As early as 1868 he sold a
picture which found its way to The Hague Gallery. This,
representing cattle in a green meadow, at once showed his
talent for painting warm sunlight. A typical picture of
Cattle hangs in this gallery; for the chief subjects of Willem
Maris's pictures are cows in meadow lands; sometimes
they are waiting to be milked, or are being milked; sometimes
they are standing or lying under the trees; and sometimes
they are knee-deep in one of the lakes.</p>

<p>Mr. Marius says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Willem's Style contrasted with his Brother Jacob's.</b>&mdash;"The
two brothers Maris [Jacob and Willem] treat their skies
in exactly opposite manners. The one depicts clouds, threatening
storm, and changeable weather, whereas the younger brother
gives us only sunshine and a sky of turquoise blue; if, however,
clouds are introduced, they are like small white feathers or like
the petals of a white rose. Each in his own way true to nature,
and beautiful to gaze upon, yet methinks that we must give the
preference to the one who gives us that greatest of all blessings,
sunshine.</p>

<p>"A very favorite aspect of his is a cloudless sky, the brightest
of suns, and part of the canvas thrown into deep shade, producing
a wonderful contrast.</p>

<p>"Another bewitching feature, so truly Dutch, in Maris's landscapes,
is the rising mist after the heat of the day. It rises
from the meadows at sunset and covers the land like a cloak,
especially after a hot day when the ground has been baked."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

a few faithful friends, such as Swan (the animal painter) and
Van Wisselingh, break in occasionally upon his solitude. But
his ideas are still socialistic, not only theoretically, but materially;
and, without looking around, he gives what he receives.
On this point he is likewise very sensitive. To be waited on by
another, although that service is paid for, he considers humiliating;
and, in order to avoid such a possibility, he lives without
the comfort of attendance.</p>

<p>"Many might pass by the works of Maris without even noticing
them; many may consider them impossible and inexplicable,
and pass on, almost out of humor, perhaps even angry
with them; the rational spectator will put questions to which
he will receive no satisfactory replies.</p>

<p><b>Two Pictures representing Albert Neuhuys.</b>&mdash;Albert
Neuhuys, born in Utrecht in 1844, studied in the Academy
of Drawing in Antwerp, and settled in Amsterdam, the
painter of landscapes and scenes from homely and humble
life. He is represented by The Doll's Dressmaker and By
the Cradle, which represents a mother leaning over the
cradle of her baby lying comfortably on pillows. It is interesting
to note how thickly the artist has spread the paint
on the canvas.</p>

<p><b>A Characteristic Picture by Christoffel Bisschop.</b>&mdash;Christoffel
Bisschop (1828-1904) may be studied by The
Lord Gave and the Lord hath Taken Away, Sunday in Hindeloopen,
Sister of the Bride, and Winter in Friesland,
also called Repairing Skates. This is a very characteristic
and typical picture. Friesland is not only the home of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
peculiar style of brightly painted furniture, but also the
home of a school of skating of which there are two schools,&mdash;the
Dutch and the Frisian. The latter, which is the
older, aims at speed; and the skater wears a peculiar kind
of skate, well shown on the foot of the young girl seated on
the right, who is having the other skate repaired. The
carved and colored sledges are also typical of Friesland.
An escort waits at the door. The painter was himself a
native of Friesland, and therefore depicts the costumes,
furniture, houses, and people of this most picturesque corner
of Holland with accuracy, charm, and sympathy.</p>

<p><b>Christoffel Bisschop.</b>&mdash;Christoffel Bisschop is the Dutch
colorist <i>par excellence</i>. He entered the studio of Schmidt
in Delft, and worked at The Hague under Huib van Hove.
He also studied in Paris with Le Comte and Gleyre, and in
1855 established himself in The Hague. A visit to the
quaint town of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Hinloopen'">Hindeloopen</ins> charmed his artistic eye, and
henceforth the peasants, with their gay costumes, and the
brightly painted furniture and quaint houses, have furnished
themes and settings for his pictures.</p>

<p><b>H. W. Mesdag.</b>&mdash;Born in Groningen in 1831, Hendrick
Willem Mesdag was destined to follow the family business
of banking. Art, however, claimed him; and after painting
for several years as an amateur he started work in
Brussels in 1866. Except for the criticisms of Roelofs,
Alma-Tadema, and other artists, Mesdag may be said to be
self-taught. In 1869 he removed to The Hague, so that
he could be near Scheveningen, for he had found his special
talent. "I must go and live near the sea," he said,
"gaze upon it daily, not only for weeks, but for months
and years; watch and study its every movement, this ever-changing
element, this amazing, stupendous work of the
Almighty!" In 1870 he exhibited at the Paris Salon, and
his Breakers in the North Sea received the gold medal.
His fame was now established. France has decorated
Mesdag more than once, and one of his sea pictures hangs
in the Luxembourg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p><b>His Style.</b>&mdash;Mesdag is a realist, and with broad, bold
strokes of the brush he portrays what he sees and feels.
He depicts the ever-changing ocean in all its moods, at all
times of day and in all seasons; and the life of the fisherfolk
on the shore and in the fishing-boats is also treated
with sympathy. His Calm Sea by Sunset, painted in 1878,
and Fishing-boats at Sea and Beach, the two latter painted
in 1895, belong to this gallery.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"High up in the scale, and standing somewhat apart, is

speak of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ludolf' and 'Lodewijk' Backhuysen/ Bakhuysen were used in this text. This was retained.">Lodewijk</ins> Backhuysen and Bonaventure Peeters, he
introduced a thorough reform. In the beginning of the century
he was preceded by men of note, such as Schotel, Waldorp,
Meyer, Greive, Van Heemskerck, Van Beest, Van Deventer;
but their chief aim was to remain true to the tradition of the
great period. They painted pretty little ships sailing on calm
seas, their white sails catching a gentle breeze and reflecting
the rays of the sun; or again they would paint large vessels,
driven before a gale over mountainous waves. But the one was
as artificial as the other; their water was like glass, their ships
as if made of tin, their skies seemed cut out of oilcloth, and not
one showed that he felt any love for the sea.</p>

<p>"Mesdag was the first to paint the sea as it is, the turbulent,
restless, omnipotent, unlimited sea, that free, majestic, and
mysterious element which cannot be brought within any formula,
but can only be rendered in its tossing and pitching, peopled by
its 'children of the sea' living on its shores or drifting on its
billows. He studied every movement of the waves, every tint
of the water, every change in the ever-changing sky; he bade
good-bye to large vessels, huge castles of the sea, and took to
painting small ships and fishing smacks, the cottages, so to
speak, of the ocean. His painting is as broad and manly as
the element wherein he moves and the space it covers; not as
soft and transparent as the works of landscape painters,&mdash;those
who give us meadows and downs,&mdash;but yet a revelation."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p></div>

<p><b>A Survey of Modern Dutch Art.</b>&mdash;A brief survey of
modern Dutch art, condensed from the learned pen of Max
Rooses, will not be unwelcome, particularly as we shall meet
many more examples of the modern artists.</p>

<p><b>The French Neo-Classical School.</b>&mdash;He tells us that the
group of Dutch and Belgian figure-painters of the beginning
of the century were descendants of the French neo-classical
school; and until 1850 the principles of David, Gros, and
Girodet were highly respected. The best-known representatives
were John William Pieneman in Holland, and Bree,
Navez, and Paelinck in Belgium.</p>

<p><b>The Romantic School.</b>&mdash;Thereupon followed the Romantic
school, whose leaders in France were Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix,
Horace Vernet, and Descamps; in Belgium, Wappers and
De Keyser; in Holland, Huib van Hove, Herman Ten Cate,
Charles Rochussen, Stroebel, and Van Trigt. This school
departed from the academic tendency of its predecessors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
just as romantic literature declared war against classicism
in poetry.</p>

<p><b>The Secret of the Success of the Romanticists.</b>&mdash;Another
source helped to swell the stream of Romanticism
in Holland. The artists of the neo-classical school, with
their pompous but severe forms, paid more attention to line
than to color. They took their example from the Italians
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Their successors
set themselves to study the masters of their own country,
and learned to appreciate the rich coloring, the warm lights,
and harmonious tones of the golden period of their own art.
We can see that they were filled with admiration for the
effects of light and color in Rembrandt's works and in those
of De Hooch, Gerrit Dou, and Ter Borch.</p>

<p>Not only did they find subjects for rich and warm coloring
and pleasing treatment in the history of former days,
but also in that of their own times. They took, in fact, a
great step forward in that they observed the daily life around
them, and kept in touch with their fellow-creatures, their
ways and habits. To this group belongs Hubert van Hove,
who was the first to admire the works of the old masters,
and again to carry on the broken tradition; Charles
Rochussen, Stroebel, to whom the effects of light and
color were particularly attractive; and Herman Ten Cate
and Van Trigt, the talented painters of romantic scenes
derived from history.</p>

<span class="caption">ISRA&Euml;LS<br />
Old Jewish Peddler</span>
</div>

<p><b>Josef Isra&euml;ls, a Brilliant Painter in this Group.</b>&mdash;To
this group belongs Josef Isra&euml;ls in his earliest works. During
this period of his brilliant career he was filled with
enthusiasm for all that is sweet, joyous, and charming in
the world, all that is fair in youth and nature; this is the
period of his Children of the Sea, his Fishwomen, and
his Knitting Girls. Later his subjects became more serious,
and more serious, too, the claims of his art. Many
followed Isra&euml;ls's example. The group of admirers of the
master, those who saw the world as he did,&mdash;though with
their own eyes,&mdash;may be called the pith and kernel of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
young Dutch school. Blommers, Valkenburg, Neuhuys, and
Artz may be placed at the head. They did not take life
quite so sadly, they did not wish to obscure light and color
but allowed the sun to blaze and triumph over mystery and
darkness.</p>

<p><b>A New Party opposed to the Romanticists.</b>&mdash;In opposition
to these "champions of twilight and tenderness"
arose those who preferred the real and substantial: Breitner;
Sosselin de Jong, the portrait-painter; Witkamp;
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Schwartze, and Van der Waay.</p>

<p>A similar movement took place in landscape-painting.
The most important landscape-artists in the first half of
the nineteenth century were Kobell, Koekkoek, and Schelfhout.
Their great ideal was a careful, almost painful,
working out of detail; they selected subjects rich in
material, masses of big trees against water, producing
great effects of light and shade. They sought to captivate
the eye by an abundance of detail, and to depict woods
and meadows with a smoothness which was more artificial
than natural.</p>

<p><b>Bilders, Roelofs, and their Followers.</b>&mdash;What was called
the picturesque in a landscape became unnecessary to the
younger men of the newer school; they painted Nature in
its own beauty and in the simplicity of its charm, as they
saw it in their daily lives. Of this group Bilders is the most
important. He admired in the landscape, not a favorite
spot, or a pretty pool, or a gayly colored cow; he saw rather
land and meadow and wood in the mass, as one whole, beautiful
by reason of its grand lines, its rich tones. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'William' and 'Willem' Roelofs were used in this text. This was retained.">William</ins>
Roelofs went a step further; his first works differ little from
those of his predecessors, but by degrees he tore himself
away from the accepted style and became a true reformer.
It was no longer the color or the beautiful contours of a
view that attracted him, but the country itself, the vegetation,
the verdure, the cattle in the meadows, the sky that
seems always holiday-making, the ever-changing clouds,
always full of beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>A whole school followed in this new track,&mdash;Van de
Sande Bakhuijzen, Mevrouw Bilders van Bosse and Mevrouw
Mesdag, Van Borselen, Storlenbeker, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Gabri&euml;l' and 'Gabriel' were used in this text. This was retained.">Gabri&euml;l</ins>, who
depicted with extraordinary fidelity both land and sea;
John Vrolijk, whose cows are always grazing in sunny
meadows under a brilliantly blue sky; De Haas, whose
cattle are more heavy and massive; Du Chattel, who prefers
the effect of light in Spring and in Autumn; Apol,
who devotes himself almost exclusively to snow scenes,
producing singularly charming effects of the sun shining
upon monotonous whiteness; Mari Ten Kate, De Bock,
Wijsm&uuml;ller, Weissenbruch, and Tholen.</p>

<p><b>Another Step in the Modern Direction.</b>&mdash;Another step
in the modern direction was taken by artists who gave themselves
up entirely to the impression of the landscape, and
painted exactly what they saw; Ter Meulen, for instance,
who loves Nature for the mood which she awakes in him,
and who understands so well how to convey light and tone
into his clever and refined pictures; Anton Mauve, and
the brothers William and Jacob Maris, were also accomplished
interpreters of nature, and all that lives and moves
therein.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Modern Dutch Painters pursuing Independent Lines.</b>&mdash;Of
other modern Dutch painters pursuing different lines
may be mentioned Bosboom, who devoted himself chiefly
to the interiors of old churches, bringing out the play of
light and shadow among the pillars; Klinkenberg, who
paints Dutch streets and canals and the old buildings upon
them in full sunshine; Jansen, who paints the Amsterdam
docks and quays; Alma-Tadema, painter of classical scenes;
Bisschop, the great colorist; David Bles, "the witty portrayer
of morals and manners of years ago"; Henrietta
Ronner-Knip, the famous painter of cats and dogs; Henkes,
who depicts in grayish tones old-fashioned scenes and characters;
Bakker Korff, who paints similar scenes, but in
miniature; the brothers Oyens; Elchanon Verveer, painter
of jolly old fishermen; Sad&eacute;e; Mejuffrouw van de Sande<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Bakhuijzen, and Mejuffrouw Roosenboom, painters of
flowers and fruit; Eerelman and Van Essen, the animal
painters; Alleb&eacute;, the colorist, painter of human figures and
animals; and Kaemmerer, who is fond of painting figures
in the costumes of the Directoire.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be well now to make a day's trip to Haarlem.
The steam tram takes us through an interesting country,
and in about an hour we reach the centre of the town,&mdash;the
Groote Markt,&mdash;in which are several old buildings,
the meat market, the Groote Kerk, and the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'town-hall' and 'town hall' were used in this text. This was retained.">Town Hall</ins>.
The latter is the chief object of our visit to Haarlem, for it
contains ten large pictures by Frans Hals, which no admirer
of this great master can afford to neglect.</p>

<p>The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'town-hall' and 'town hall' were used in this text. This was retained.">Town Hall</ins>, facing the Groote Kerk, was originally
a palace of the counts of Holland. It was begun in the
twelfth century, but was remodelled in 1620 and 1630, when
a wing was added. Some of the large beams in the interior
date from the thirteenth century. The walls of the vestibule
are decorated with coats of arms and portraits of the
counts and countesses of Holland.</p>

<p><b>The Room containing Hals's Doelen Pictures.</b>&mdash;We
pass at once into the principal room, where the famous
Regent (or <i>Doelen</i>) pictures by Hals are arranged in chronological
order. These pictures represent nearly all the
artist's working period. The Banquet of the Officers of
the Guild of the Archers of St. George was painted in
1616, when the artist was thirty-five; the same subject,
with different portraits, in 1627; the Banquet of the Officers
of the Arquebusiers of St. Andrew, in 1622, when the
corps departed for the siege of Hasselt and Mons; Reunion
of the Arquebusiers of St. Andrew, in 1633; and Officers and
Sub-Officers of the Arquebusiers of St. George, in 1639.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>As the enormous canvases each contain from fourteen to
twenty life-size portraits, we feel as if we were entering a
hall full of convivial officers, laughing, jesting, and making
merry over their fine wines and choice food. They are
richly dressed; many of them wear lace cuffs and ruffs and
bright scarfs; flags flutter, spears glitter, spurs and swords
clank and flash in the sunlight; the plumes on the large
hats nod; and loud talk and bursts of laughter seem to
issue from the frames. These convivial men have fought
against the hated Spaniards, and are ready to trail a pike
at any moment. The artist was commanded to paint each
man accurately and according to his rank in the company.
Every picture is, therefore, a group of portraits; and Colonel
Jan Claasz Loo, in the picture of 1633, is considered
one of Hals's masterpieces of portraiture. These pictures
rank with Rembrandt's and Van der Helst's works of this
class.</p>

<p>In addition to these are Regents of the Hospital of
St. Elizabeth (1641), Regents of the Old Men's Almshouse,
and Lady Regents of the Old Men's Almshouse, both
painted in 1664, when Hals was over eighty. Two fine
portraits of Nicholas van der Meer, Burgomaster of Haarlem,
and his wife, are dated 1631. A copy of a portrait of
Frans Hals by himself hangs in an adjoining room.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Crowe on Hals's Earlier and Later Styles.</b>&mdash;"In every
form of his art we can distinguish his earlier style from that of
later years. Two Boys Playing and Singing, in the Gallery of
Cassel, and A Banquet of Officers, in the Museum of Haarlem,
exhibit him as a careful draughtsman, capable of great finish,
yet spirited withal. His flesh, less clear than it afterwards became,
is pastose and burnished. Further on he becomes more
effective, displays more freedom of hand and a greater command
of effect. At this period we note the beautiful full-length
of a young lady of the Berensteyn family in the house of that
name in Haarlem, and a splendid full-length of A Patrician
Leaning on a Sword, in the Lichtenstein Collection at Vienna.
Both these pictures are equalled by the Banquets of Officers of
1627, and a Meeting of the Company of St. George, of 1633,
in the Haarlem Museum. A picture of the same kind in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'town-hall' and 'town hall' were used in this text. This was retained.">Town Hall</ins> of Amsterdam, with the date of 1637, suggests some
study of the masterpieces of Rembrandt, and a similar influence
is apparent in a picture of 1641 at Haarlem, representing the
Regents of the Company of St. Elizabeth.... Rembrandt's
example did not create a lasting impression on Hals. He gradually
dropped more and more into gray and silvery harmonies
of tone; and two of his canvases, executed in 1664,&mdash;the
Regents and Regentesses of the Oudemannenhuis, at Haarlem,&mdash;are
masterpieces of color, though in substance they are
but monochromes."</p>

<p><b>His Pictures of Various Strata of Society.</b>&mdash;"Hals's pictures
illustrate the various strata of society into which his
misfortunes led him. His banquets or meetings of officers, of
sharpshooters and guildsmen, are the most interesting of his
works. But they are not more characteristic than his low-life
pictures of itinerant players and singers. His portraits of
gentlefolk are true and noble, but hardly so expressive as those
of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'fish-wives' and 'fishwives' were used in this text. This was retained.">fishwives</ins> and tavern heroes. His first master was Van
Mander, the painter and historian, of whom he possessed
some pictures. But he soon left behind him the practice of
the time illustrated by Schoreel and Moro, and, emancipating
himself gradually from tradition, produced pictures remarkable
for truth and dexterity of hand."</p>

<p><b>Hals and Rembrandt compared.</b>&mdash;"We prize in Rembrandt
the golden glow of effects based upon artificial contrasts of low
light in immeasurable gloom. Hals was fond of daylight, of
silvery sheen. Both men were painters of touch, but of touch
on different keys. Rembrandt was the bass, Hals the treble.
The latter is, perhaps, more expressive than the former. He
seizes with rare intuition a moment in the life of his sitters.
What nature displays in that moment he reproduces thoroughly
in a very delicate scale of color, and with a perfect mastery over
every form of expression. He becomes so clever at last that
exact tone, light and shade, and modelling are all obtained with
a few marked and fluid strokes of the brush."</p></div>

<p><b>The Teyler Museum.</b>&mdash;We can afford to neglect the
Teyler Museum, unless we are particularly interested in the
study of modern Dutch art. In that case, we can view there
some excellent examples of Isra&euml;ls, Mauve, Mesdag, Ten
Cate, J. Koster, Bosboom, Verveer, Eeckhout, Koekkoek,
and others. The Teyler Museum also contains a valuable
collection of engravings and drawings by old masters, including
Rembrandt, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Michelangelo' and 'Michael Angelo' were used in this text. This was retained.">Michelangelo</ins>, Goltzius, and A. van

<p><b>The Paviljoen Welgelegen.</b>&mdash;Taking the tram to Frederiks-Park,
we may glance at the Paviljoen Welgelegen, a
<i>ch&acirc;teau</i> built in 1788 by Mr. Hope, an Amsterdam banker,
and which was purchased by Louis Napoleon when he became
King of Holland. It was to this building that the
modern pictures were removed from the Trippenhuis in
1838. This now shelters a Colonial Museum and a
Museum of Industrial Art, both of great interest.

<p>The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Boijmans' and 'Boijman's' were used in this text. This was retained.">Boijmans</ins> (or Boymans) Museum, on the Schiedamsche
Dyk, was founded by a bequest of Mr. F.
J. O. Boijmans, who died in 1847. His fine collection of
360 paintings suffered by fire in 1864, and only 163 of them
were left. These were housed in a new building, completed
in 1867. By means of various bequests and purchases, the
collection has been increased to more than four hundred
paintings and two thousand drawings and engravings. The
ground-floor contains the drawings and engravings, the
Library of Rotterdam (30,000 volumes), and the Portrait-room.
The upper floor consists of six galleries, two of
which are devoted to modern pictures.</p>

<p><b>Two Classes of Landscapes in this Museum.</b>&mdash;The
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Boijmans' and 'Boijman's' were used in this text. This was retained.">Boijmans</ins> Museum is rich in landscapes. These naturally
fall into two classes: first, the works of those men who
studied in Italy or at least owed their inspiration to others
who did; and secondly, pictures of purely Dutch scenery
with the peasants, flocks, and herds familiar to the native.
The classical landscapes are framed with mountains, and
usually have cascades and ruins, and often are peopled
with nymphs, shepherds, and other figures classically draped.
Many examples of this school have already been noted in
The Hague and Amsterdam museums.</p>

<p><b>Painters of Italian Landscapes.</b>&mdash;Jan Miel (1599-1664)
went to Rome and studied under Andreas Sacchi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
His Italian Landscape, alive with travellers, is similar in
feeling and treatment to many others in this gallery by Jan
van de Meer, Jr., Adam Pynacker, J. Lingelbach, Jacob
van Huchtenburgh, Willem de Heusch, Jan Hackaert,
J. van Bronckhorst, Pieter Bout, Jan Both, Adriaen Bloemaert,
and Johannes van der Bent. In many of these classical
landscapes the figures are supplied by A. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>
and Lingelbach.</p>

<p><b>Poelenburg's Figure-painting.</b>&mdash;Poelenburg painted the
figures in the pictures of some of his contemporaries,&mdash;in
the Rocky Landscape by Willem de Heusch, for instance.
In this panel we find the usual road with women, children,
cattle, sheep, goats, trees, cascade, rocks covered with vegetation,
shepherd with flock, travellers with a pack-mule, and
mountainous background.</p>

<p><b>A. Bloemaert's Italian Landscape.</b>&mdash;Adriaen Bloemaert
(d. 1668) painted historical subjects and landscape. His
Italian Landscape exhibits goats on rocks covered with
vegetation in the foreground, from which a road rises to a
castle on a mountain. A man and a child are coming down
the road. The background is mountainous.</p>

<p><b>Dirk Maas's Camp.</b>&mdash;Dirk Maas (1656-1717) studied
successively under Mommers, Berchem, and Huchtenburgh,
and finally adopted the style of the latter. His subjects
generally are skirmishes, marches, and camps. His Camp
is full of life. The canvas of a tent is fixed to a tree-trunk.
Before the tent sits a cavalier, glass in hand and holding a
horse by the bridle, talking to a woman standing in front of
him. Inside the tent, soldiers are playing cards; on the
right, two dogs are fighting. There are other groups of
soldiers, beggars, horses, women, and children. The background
is closed by tents at the foot of an elevation crowned
by a fortress.</p>

<p><b>Jan Maartsen's Cavalry Combat.</b>&mdash;Jan Maartsen (d.
1645) painted battles and cavalry skirmishes. His Cavalry
Combat, dated 1630, shows a fight between Dutch and
Spaniards. Infantry are engaged in the background.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Vrancx's Pillage and his Promenade.</b>&mdash;Sebastian Vrancx
(or Francken) has a Pillage, somewhat similar to that of
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>. Soldiers are seen pursuing fugitives and
chasing cattle before them; one soldier takes a poor peasant
from his house as prisoner; and farther away, near a
tree, are a horseman on a rearing horse, and a house in
flames; in the middle distance the village street guarded
by the cavalry; and in the background houses, and a town
on the horizon.</p>

<p>His Promenade shows a gentleman in black, with brown
mantle and large hat ornamented with green, white, and red
feathers, offering his hand to a lady in a white dress, red
overskirt, black mantle, and red bonnet. On the right is a
grape-vine; on the left, an inn, in which several persons are
seated; and on the horizon, a town.</p>

<p>The same subject is again treated, but this time the gentleman
wears a costume of white satin and red velvet, a
brown cloak and a brown hat with a green plume, and high
leather boots, while the lady has a blue dress, a white bodice,
a tunic of red satin, a fluted ruff, and a round hat.
Fireworks are seen in the background.</p>

de Velde has a Nocturnal Combat between Cavalry and
Infantry, in which a Dutch troop of cavalry are attacking
Spanish Mousquetaires and Lansquenets, the scene illuminated
by a tent in flames. Far in the distance are the
towers and spires of a town.</p>

<p><b>Johan Huchtenburgh and his Cavalry Combat.</b>&mdash;Johan
van Huchtenburgh (1646-1733) was a pupil of Thomas
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Wijck,' 'Wyck,' and 'Wijk' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wijk</ins>. After joining his brother Jacob in Italy in 1667, and
working there for a time, he left for France, and painted
under the direction of the celebrated battle-painter, A. F.
van der Meulen. On his return to Holland in 1670 he
grew famous; afterwards he painted scenes from the wars
in which William III., Marlborough, and Prince Eugene were
prominent. His Cavalry Combat shows a fight between the
Imperial troops and the Turks in a mountainous district.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
It is full of action. The foreground is in shadow, while the
middle distance and background are fully illuminated.</p>

<p><b>Lingelbach's Country People by a Fountain.</b>&mdash;Country
People by a Fountain is the title of a picture by
J. Lingelbach. In the foreground of an Italian landscape
several country people are variously grouped; on the right,
at the foot of a rock, a fountain gushes forth, by which is
a man wrapped in sheepskin; in the centre, a woman
riding an ass, is talking to another woman, who stands by
her side; then comes a boy; then a man is seen drinking
from the fountain, his ass beside him. On the left, another
peasant is riding a white horse laden with panniers; and by
his side walks a man with a stick in his hand, and followed
by a dog. On the left is a lake; and mountains form the
background.</p>

<p><b>Three Landscapes by Adam Pynacker.</b>&mdash;The Rotterdam
Gallery owns three pictures by Adam Pynacker. In
An Italian Landscape a line of high mountains edges the
horizon, from which stretches a plain; and in the foreground
on the right, a river flows from a high mountain
through a rocky gorge. Two men are fishing; and near
them are a dog and an ass. On the left a road leads to a
small lake, on the borders of which a herdsman and his
cattle are advancing. In the Mountainous Landscape a
ruined tower stands at the foot of a high rock on the left;
and along the road that is lost behind the hill and rocks in
the foreground, peasants and their cattle are seen. The
setting sun throws its warm rays over the wooded hills and
over the river that winds through the vast landscape and
upon the figures, and illuminates a cow and a goat browsing
among the bushes and rocks. On the Border of a
Lake shows a sheet of water illuminated by the sun, and
on the left several persons are embarking. In the distance
are rocky peaks partly wooded; and men are fishing from
the shore of the lake.</p>

<p><b>Jacob Huchtenburgh's Mountainous Landscape.</b>&mdash;Jacob
van Huchtenburgh followed his master, Berchem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
In the foreground of his Mountainous Landscape a road
crosses a river by a three-arched stone bridge. In the
road are some sheep and peasants; and a shepherd
with an ass and two cows is crossing the bridge. At a
ford on the right a man is watering two horses. Some
distance away there is a cloister at the foot of a high
mountain, before which are monks, peasants, and a carriage
and horses. Higher up the mountain are a farm,
a castle, and a group of buildings surrounded by walls.
Peasants are dancing in a valley on the left. Finally,
we see a vast mountain landscape through which a river
winds.</p>

<p><b>Moucheron's Mountainous Landscape.</b>&mdash;Another Mountainous
Landscape is by Moucheron. In the foreground
we observe a woman on a white horse. She is talking
to a man who descends a hill. Some country people
are wading through a ford, and on the other side of the
stream stands a ruined tower. The picture is lighted
by the warm rays of the setting sun. Adriaen <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>
painted the figures.</p>

<p><b>Two Imitators of Poelenburg's Style.</b>&mdash;Jan van Bronckhorst
has an Italian Landscape in the style of Poelenburg,
by which he is most commonly known. There are ruins
partly surrounded by water, two bathers, a shepherd and
goats, a stone bridge, and mountainous background. Another
imitator of Poelenburg was Jacob Esselens (b. 1628),
who painted landscapes, marines, and town views. A
Landscape shows a distinguished company of ladies and
gentlemen beside a stream with carriages, horses, hounds,
herons, and falcons. On the river are a yacht and a row-boat;
and, in the distance, a castle among the trees. The
scene is full of color and movement.</p>

<p><b>Jan Beerstraten and his Town Gate.</b>&mdash;Jan Beerstraten
(d. 1660) painted marines and town views; but
nothing is known of him except that he married Magdalena
Bronckhorst. His drawing is good, color excellent,
and brush work strong. Some of his marines will bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
comparison with those of Backhuysen. A. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>
sometimes painted his figures. A Town Gate, signed and
dated 1654, worthily displays his powers. In a mountainous
country we see a town, with its churches, towers, gates,
and fortifications, situated on both sides of a river; on the
water several boats are sailing and rowing; and, on the
banks, people are bathing and promenading.</p>

<p><b>Jan Hackaert's Mountainous Landscape.</b>&mdash;Jan Hackaert
has a fine Mountainous Landscape with a shepherd
playing a clarinet by a stream, and a couple of peasants
dancing, watched by a man with his back to us. On a
hill to the right, under tall trees, are a hunter and his dog;
to the left, a man on horseback followed by a dog. A
road runs along the banks of a lake, at the foot of a high
mountain brightly illuminated by the sun, on which three
cavaliers are approaching at a fast trot. The figures and
animals in this canvas belong to J. Lingelbach.</p>

<p><b>Berchem and Two who painted in his Style.</b>&mdash;Johannes
van der Bent (1650-90) was a pupil of Ph. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>
and A. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>; but he also imitated the style of
N. Berchem. He has an Italian Landscape in which a
shepherdess is milking a goat in the foreground, with
another woman and a boy near her; farther on are a white
horse and cattle. The mountainous background has a cascade
as usual. Berchem is not strongly represented here,&mdash;only
by A Grotto: a woman and two men, one mounted
on an ass, are driving cattle over a ford. On the right,
a shepherd is driving a flock of sheep; there are high
mountains in the distance. Dirk van Berghen has also a
Landscape and Animals in this style with mountainous and
woody perspective.</p>

<p><b>J. Both's Italian Landscape: Evening.</b>&mdash;Johannes
Both has another of his pictures here that shows the influence
of Claude Lorraine. In the Italian Landscape: Evening,
the left foreground is occupied by tall trees; a chariot
is drawn by two oxen along a road leading to an old tower;
on the horizon is a town on the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'sea-shore' and 'seashore' were used in this text. This was retained.">sea-shore</ins>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p><b>P. Bout's Italian Seaport.</b>&mdash;Pieter Bout (1658-1702)
almost always worked in collaboration with N.
Boudwijns, for whose landscapes he supplied figures.
Works exclusively his own are very rare. He belonged to
the Flemish-Italian school, and has here a busy and lively
Italian Seaport in the style of J. B. Weenix. It is signed
and dated 1669, which hardly agrees with the date given
for his birth unless he was very precocious.</p>

<p><b>Other Painters in the Same Group.</b>&mdash;In this group
also we might include Gerrit Claes Bleecker (d. 1656),
whose work recalls Elzheimer and his followers. His Saul
on the Road to Damascus is classical rather than Biblical
in sentiment, and the landscape is Italian.</p>

<p><b>Weenix's Tobias Sleeping under a Vine.</b>&mdash;The same
may be said of the charming Tobias Sleeping under a Vine
by J. B. Weenix. In this there is a house on the right,
against the wall of which is a vine under which Tobias is
sleeping. A magpie is flying above his head, and beside
him are various objects such as this artist loved to paint,&mdash;vegetables,
a great copper milk pan, a yoke, harness, and
other things, including a basket of grapes and an earthen
pitcher. In the background a man is mounting a ladder.
The picture is signed and dated 1662, two years before the
painter's death.</p>

<p>Hendrick Mommers (1623-97) also has an Italian
Landscape. He imitated the style of Karel Dujardin,
another painter of this school. Frederick de Moucheron
has a Mountainous Landscape. His pictures also were
peopled by the indefatigable <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">Van de Velde</ins> and Lingelbach.</p>

<p><b>Landscape Setting for The Good Samaritan.</b>&mdash;Joris van
der Hagen is another who makes use of a Biblical episode
as an excuse for a landscape, or for the frame of the subject,
as in his Landscape Serving as a Frame for the Parable of
the Good Samaritan. In the foreground on the left, near
two tall trees, the Good Samaritan has dismounted and is
stanching the wounds of the traveller; four dogs are near
the ass; not far away the brigands are descending a path at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the foot of a mountain. On the right is the Levite, and
farther back is the Pharisee, going away in a different
direction. In the background is a river crossed by a three-arched
bridge, on the other side of which are high buildings
surrounded with trees. Mountains close the view.</p>

<p><b>Boaz and Ruth in an Italian Setting.</b>&mdash;Gerbrand van
den Eeckhout (1621-74), although a pupil of Rembrandt,
painted so-called Biblical scenes in much the same spirit.
Thus his Boaz and Ruth has an Italian setting. In the
foreground Boaz is talking to his servant; Ruth is standing
beside the latter with her apron full of wheat. On the left
is a barn surrounded with trees; in front of it three harvesters
are eating their meal; on the right beside a plough
are a straw hat, a game-bag, and a pitcher. In the background
is a field of corn which is being reaped and sheafed.
Mountains close the scene.</p>

<p><b>Balaam, by the Same Artist.</b>&mdash;Again in Balaam, trees
and a river, high mountains and ruins, form the background.
The prophet is seated on his ass, and beating him with a
stick to make him advance; but on the left an angel in
white with golden wings stops him, sword in hand. Balaam
is followed by two horsemen in Roman costume, and
behind them is a chariot drawn by two horses.</p>

<p><b>The Flight into Egypt with an Italian Background.</b>&mdash;Pieter
Lastman painted an Italian landscape as a background
for the Flight into Egypt. Here we see the Virgin
Mary on an ass with the Infant Jesus in her arms, and by
her side walks Joseph, carrying his carpenter's tools. A
tree is seen on the left; and a cascade, ruins, and rocks in
the background on the right.</p>

<p><b>Van der Weyden's The Apostle John.</b>&mdash;Rogier van
der Weyden (1390-1464) is an early master who painted in
this style. In his The Apostle St. John, the Apostle is seated
in the foreground of a landscape, writing on a sheet of
paper which lies on his knees. He wears a red robe, and a
large red mantle lined with green falls from his shoulders
and covers his knees with ample folds. Behind him, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
winged demon empties his inkstand. On the left two
gentleman are seen on horseback, and the background
shows a mountainous landscape traversed by a river and
enlivened by a castle and a fortified town.</p>

<p><b>Van der Maes and Van der Werff.</b>&mdash;Evert Crijnsz van
der Maes (1577-1646) has a St. Jerome in a landscape,
signed and dated 1609. Another picture of a hermit is by
B. Matton, who lived a little later. Pieter van der Werff
has a Repentant Magdalen, who is kneeling in a grotto with
hands crossed on her breast, while she reads a parchment
scroll covered with Hebraic characters.</p>

<p><b>Jan van Byler's Picture of Rachel and her Father.</b>&mdash;Jan
van Byler, born in Utrecht in the second half of the seventeenth
century, and pupil of his father, is rarely met with in
either public or private galleries. Here, however, we find
Laban Reproaching Rachel for having Carried off his Household
Gods. In the foreground, Rachel is seated holding
by one hand a little boy, while with the other she makes a
gesture, as if to ward off the reproaches of Laban, who is
standing before her. On the right is a young man carrying
a basket. A brown and white dog lies in the foreground;
and in the distance are seen two men and a camel near a
tent attached to the trunk of a tree.</p>

<p><b>H. Goltzius.</b>&mdash;H. Goltzius is represented by an interesting
picture, Juno Receiving the Eyes of Argus Killed by
Mercury. Mercury is seated on a red cloak; in his right
hand he holds one of the eyes of Argus, which Juno, descending
on a cloud, is about to receive in her robe. Before
him are the severed head and corpse of Argus and a
naked sword. A rocky landscape extends to the right, and
on the left, in the clouds, the chariot of Juno, drawn by
peacocks.</p>

<p><b>Moreelse's Vertumnus and Pomona.</b>&mdash;An interesting
mythological picture by Moreelse is called Vertumnus and
Pomona. The latter is seated under the trees to the left
with her face turned toward the spectator. She wears a
yellow silk dress with a blue tunic; her right hand holds a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
pruning-hook and her left a bunch of white grapes. A little
behind her Vertumnus is seen in the guise of an old woman,
leaning on a stick and extending the left hand.</p>

<p><b>De Vos's Allegory, Crowned by Riches.</b>&mdash;Cornelius
de Vos (1585-1651), pupil of David Remens, has an Allegory,
Crowned by Riches. On the right, under a red tent
fringed with gold, a young woman in a green dress and
mantle embroidered with gold, a crown of gold in her right
hand and a sceptre in her left, stands majestically. Before
her kneels a farmer to be crowned, and he extends his hand
to the fruits and vegetables in the foreground. On a table
to the right, covered with a crimson cloth, are various objects
of gold and silver. Farther back under the tent are
two women, a negro, and Love. In the middle distance is
Time with his scythe. To the left in the background, a
landscape, where people are tilling the soil.</p>

<p><b>An Allegory by De Wit.</b>&mdash;Jacob de Wit also has an Allegory.
Minerva, in a landscape, is seated with her right
hand on her harp; in front of her, four naked children are
sporting, and one is playing a harp.</p>

<p><b>A Classical Scene by Van der Ulft.</b>&mdash;Jacob van der Ulft
has a picture, painted in 1674, representing The Betrothed
of Allucius Led as Prisoner Before Scipio. Ruins of temples
and city walls and gates are seen to right and left. In the
foreground are Scipio, the betrothed of Allucius, and other
prisoners. Farther back are Roman soldiers with chariots,
elephants, camels, and spoils of war. In the background a
town is seen at the base of the mountains.</p>

<p><b>Achilles Recognized by Ulysses, by Van Limborch.</b>&mdash;Achilles
Recognized by Ulysses, by H. van Limborch, shows
Achilles kneeling on the ground in the dress of a woman
with a blue chalmys, having a sword in his right and the
scabbard in his left hand; he is recognized by Ulysses who,
with another person, is standing behind him. On the
ground lie a helmet, a shield, several precious objects, and
some jewels which are being examined and handled by the
wives of Lycomedes, King of Scyros. In the background<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
on the left is the peristyle of a palace; and on the right are
several persons near a statue and a boat.</p>

<p><b>De Vriendt's The Death of Lucrezia.</b>&mdash;The Death of
Lucrezia, by Frans Floris de Vriendt, is painted in a similar
vein. Lucrezia is on her knees, in a despairing pose, and
about to stab herself. In the background several buildings
are seen.</p>

<p><b>Painters of Purely Dutch Scenery.</b>&mdash;Turning now to
painters of purely Dutch scenery and outdoor life, the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Boijmans' and 'Boijman's' were used in this text. This was retained.">Boijmans</ins> contains many pictures by the followers of Rembrandt,
Potter, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>. Some of these
display the open country, and others the life by the wayside,
in the streets, and in the vicinity of towns. There are
many charming pictures of the outdoor life of the gentry,
the tradesmen, and the farmers. We have scenes of hunting,
hawking, fishing, promenades, and cavalcades, with
beautiful landscape surroundings, and several pictures of
the farm, pure and simple.</p>

<p><b>Three Pictures by Jacob <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>.</b>&mdash;Jacob Ruisdael
has one picture, The Corn Field, which represents a hilly
landscape. In the foreground brushwood, heath, and moss;
on the right two oaks and, on an incline, a wheat-field
partly cut, and mowers who are resting. On the horizon,
to the left, is the sea with a few sails upon it.</p>

<p>Another picture is called A Sandy Road, and on this,
which leads through brushwood and oak-trees, trudge two
persons. On the right is a pool partly hidden in shadow.</p>

<p>The third picture by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins> represents The Old Fish-Market
at Amsterdam. On the right is the tower of the
old church; in the foreground are the fish-venders sitting
at their stalls and many promenaders; and in the background
is the canal, on which boats are lying and sails

in it. On the left are several tall trees, beneath which are
cows and sheep; and far in the distance some men are
fishing from the bank.</p>

<p><b>A Wooded Landscape by Hobbema.</b>&mdash;A Wooded
Landscape and Landscape by Hobbema are characteristic
examples. The first shows fine treatment of light. The
sun piercing through thick clouds lights the middle distance,
while foreground and background are in shadow.
Among the tall trees in the background a barn is seen;
then a boy and a woman fording the stream; a shepherd
and some sheep near a willow tree; then come two tree-trunks
and some brushwood; then a winding road, on
which a peasant and a boy are walking; then a sheet of
water bordered by willows.</p>

<p><b>Another Landscape by Hobbema.</b>&mdash;The other Landscape
also shows a sheet of water in the foreground where
two persons are fishing; then a tree-trunk, half of which is
in the water; then some trees on a rising ground. A
couple of ducks are swimming in the water. In the background
a peasant's house is seen, before which a man is
standing; and on the left a second clump of trees, where
two persons are walking. The background is brilliantly
lighted; but the middle distance and the foreground are
in shadow.</p>

<p><b>Van Kessel's Landscape near Haarlem.</b>&mdash;Jan van Kessel
(1648-98), about whom little is known, and some of
whose works follow the style of J. van <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>, has here
a Landscape near Haarlem and a View of Amsterdam.
The first shows a brightly lighted foreground with a road
leading to a village on the right, the ruins of the Castle of
Brederode. Huntsmen and dogs, a shepherd and sheep,
and some swans in a moat, by Lingelbach, enliven the
scene. The middle distance is in shadow, and here we
have trees, fields, and dunes. The background shows a
brightly lighted landscape stretching away into the distance.</p>

<p><b>His View of Amsterdam.</b>&mdash;His View of Amsterdam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
shows a canal where a man is rowing a boat, a large boat
fastened on the right, some swans floating in the water on
the left. The canal, shut by the gates, is crossed by a stone
bridge, on which some people are walking. In the corner
is a quay bordered with trees, and on the horizon a clock-tower.</p>

<p><b>One of Isaak van Ostade's Rare Pictures.</b>&mdash;Isaak van
Ostade (1621-49), a pupil of his brother Adriaen, usually
painted inns and village scenes, now extremely rare. Neither
the Mauritshuis nor the Rijks owns an example.
Hence the Inn among the Dunes is of great interest. A
chariot, drawn by a white horse, is arriving before an inn
among the trees on the left. The horse is being fed, and
some travellers and children stand in front of the door. A
little boy is leading some pigs across the foreground; two
horsemen are galloping away in the distance, and the
horizon shows the dunes and a clock-tower.</p>

Landscape by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Aart' and 'Aert' van der Neer were used in this text. This was retained.">Aert</ins> van der Neer is a striking picture with
simple materials. A road, bordered with trees, is seen in
the foreground, with two persons approaching; in the middle
distance are some cows on the banks of a canal, and
peasants' houses under the trees, with a clock-tower in the
background. The sky is stormy, and the moon is rising
and throwing its rays on the water.</p>

A Blacksmith. The first shows a flat landscape with a
light brown ox, and a little farther away a sheep lying
down, and also a cow; in the background a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'farm-house' and 'farmhouse' were used in this text. This was retained.">farmhouse</ins> is
seen beneath the trees, and a vast meadow dotted with
cows stretches away to the right. The Blacksmith is in the
background at the door of his forge, before which a boy
stands with a gray horse. An ass, a cock, and some hens
lend additional animation to the little scene.</p>

van Everdingen is represented by two fine examples of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Norwegian landscape, for which he is famous. The scenes
are lively, with human figures in both.</p>

<p><b>A Hunting Scene by Keirinckx and Poelenburg.</b>&mdash;Alexander
Keirinckx (b. 1600) was a painter of landscapes
and views of towns. He painted with much truth to nature,
his foliage especially being executed with rare perfection.
Poelenburg, as a rule, painted the figures in his
pictures, as he did in A Forest, signed and dated 1630.
This is a hunting scene, with a gentleman on horseback followed
by hounds under tall trees in the foreground. Other
figures are a huntsman sounding a call, two other hunters,
and a stag in the distance among the trees.</p>

<p><b>Verboom's Evening.</b>&mdash;Abraham Hendricksz Verboom
(seventeenth century) is represented by Evening, showing
trees in the foreground, huntsmen and dogs in the middle
distance lighted by the setting sun, and behind a wooden
fence a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'farm-house' and 'farmhouse' were used in this text. This was retained.">farmhouse</ins>. In the background a clock-tower appears

<p><b>Nymegen's Swiss Landscape.</b>&mdash;Gerard van Nymegen
(1735-1808) was the pupil of his father D. van Nymegen.
He visited Germany and Switzerland. The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Boijmans' and 'Boijman's' were used in this text. This was retained.">Boijmans</ins> owns

<p><b><ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van der Heyden,' 'Van der Heyde,' and 'Venderheydene' were used in this text. This was retained.">Van der Heyde</ins>'s Ruined Castle.</b>&mdash;A good example of
Jan van der Heyde is A Ruined Castle. The scene is a
courtyard with a large tree, under which is seated a shepherd
playing a flute; a horseman is in a gateway on the
left; and several persons are standing on a stone bridge on
the right. A few clouds are floating across the clear sky.
The picture is much admired for its light and shadow.</p>

<p><b>Donck's Coming Home from Shooting.</b>&mdash;Gerrit Donck
has a canvas called Coming Home from Shooting, with a
cottage, two gentlemen, a woman, a peasant, and a boy.
In the centre, some dead game lies on an inverted tub.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
One gentleman is seated; he points to the birds and talks
to the woman. The other gentleman holds his gun and
listens to what the peasant has to say. The boy looks on.
Through the open door on the right we see a landscape in
the style of J. van Goyen.</p>

<p><b>P. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>'s Gentleman on Horseback.</b>&mdash;A Gentleman
on Horseback is by Philips Wouwermans. Mounted
on a gray horse the rider takes his way through a sandy
landscape toward the dunes that are seen on the left. He
wears a gray costume embroidered with gold, a black hat
with a white feather, and high black boots. In the background
are trees, and on the right is a pavilion.</p>

de Velde's Cavalier has always been greatly admired. Vosmaer
says: "This little figure, seen from behind, sitting so

is rearing, and the rider, whose back is turned to the spectator,
wears a felt hat, a blue cloak, and high black riding-boots."</p>

<p><b>P. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>'s Pillaging Soldiers.</b>&mdash;Philips Wouwermans
once again displays the pleasure he takes in painting
horses in his Pillaging Soldiers. In a hilly country and on
the banks of a river a soldier on a white horse is aiming at
the cheek of a peasant who is begging for mercy on his
knees; one individual lies stretched out on the ground; and
on the right a woman with her child in her arms is being
pursued by a soldier. In the middle distance, a horseman
is carrying off his booty, and on the left two horsemen are
pursuing the fugitives. A village in flames appears in the
background.</p>

<p><b>Verschuring's Horse-Shoer.</b>&mdash;Hendrick Verschuring
(1627-90) was a painter of social life, portraits, and figures,
and was a pupil of Dirk Govertsz and Jan Both. He
visited Italy. His picture here is called A Horse-Shoer.
Before the steps of the old <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'town-hall' and 'town hall' were used in this text. This was retained.">town hall</ins> of Amsterdam (represented

cloak; to the right some beggars with a dog. Among the
trees in the background a horseman is disappearing.</p>

<p><b>A Spirited Forest Scene by Looten.</b>&mdash;Another landscape
painter of this period was Jan Looten, who died in
England in 1660. Like so many of his contemporaries, he
employed others, especially <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Nicholas' and 'Nicolaes' Berchem were used in this text. This was retained.">Nicolaes</ins> Berchem, to enliven his
scenery with figures. His large picture, A Forest, signed
and dated 1658, is a spirited scene of ladies and gentlemen
mounted, with hawks on their fists and followed by
falconers. The landscape is prettily diversified with woods,
streams, and hills.</p>

<p><b>The Dunes, by J. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>.</b>&mdash;Jan Wouwermans
(1629-66), pupil of his brother Philips, has a picture of
The Dunes. In the middle of the picture is a watercourse,
which is crossed by a bridge and loses itself behind a hill
over which is seen the roof of a house.</p>

<p><b>A Sunny Picture by Molenaer.</b>&mdash;Nicolaas Molenaer
(d. 1676) has a sunny picture of a Bleaching Ground. In
the foreground is a man in a boat on a stretch of water.
To the right is the bleaching ground, in which people are
busy spreading out the linen; and on the left are cottages,
with tall trees behind.</p>

<p><b>P. de Molyn's Farm.</b>&mdash;Pieter de Molyn the Elder
(?-1661) has a pretty picture of a farm, where two peasant
men are talking to a peasant woman. A very large tree
stands in the front in full light, and behind the hedge are
a hayrick and the house.</p>

<p><b>Murant's Farm.</b>&mdash;Another farm is the work of Emanuel
Murant. A large tree and a sheet of water occupy the foreground.
Near the latter a goat is lying; then come three
pigs before a stable, and three sheep and a peasant. A
pigeon-house on four poles and a hay-wagon are seen in
the background.</p>

<p><b>Three Good Landscape-painters.</b>&mdash;Jan Breughel (1601-78)
painted so much like his father ("Velvet") that it is
hard to distinguish the one from the other. His two village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
scenes are full of the country and rural life. Michiel Carree
(1666-1747) was another painter of the country. His
Wooded Landscape with Cattle has a mountainous background;
it is animated by a shepherd, an ass, two oxen,
two goats, a ram, and several lambs. Cornelis Decker
(d. 1678) was a pupil of Salomon <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>, whom he
greatly resembles in style. His landscape depicts a peasant's
cot half hidden among trees on the bank of a stream.
On a plank crossing the latter a woman is washing clothes;
on the right are two persons in a boat; on the horizon are
trees and a clock-tower.</p>

<p><b>Netscher's Family Scene.</b>&mdash;Netscher's Family Scene,
painted in 1667, shows a group in a garden in front of an
imposing house. A gentleman in a long brown wig leans
on the base of a pillar; behind him is a statue of Justice,
and beside him a lady in white satin with a child on her
knee. Near her are two young girls; one is in red silk,
the other in blue satin. They are making floral crowns,
while three other children are twining flowers around a
statue of Love. On the left, in the foreground, is a handsome
stone vase containing a plant.</p>

<p><b>Two Landscapes.</b>&mdash;Pieter Jansz van As has a typical
Dutch landscape with rustic cottages, goats, shepherds, etc.
Jan van Gool (1685-1763) was a pupil of Terwesten and
Van der Does. His Landscape and Animals is a milking
scene in a meadow, wherein are also a dog, goat, sheep,

<p><b>A Charming Landscape by P. van der Leeuw.</b>&mdash;Another
little-known landscape-painter, Pieter van der Leeuw
(fl. 1670), was a son and pupil of Sebastiaen van der Leeuw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
He has a charming Landscape and Animals; the animals
consist of two oxen drinking at a stream, a ram, two ewes,
a goat, a sheep, and two lambs. A shepherd and shepherdess
rest under a tree. The color and composition are
excellent.</p>

<p><b>Michau's Landscape with Cottages.</b>&mdash;Theobald Michau
(1676-1765) modelled himself on D. Teniers the Younger.
His Landscape with Peasants' Cottages is full of the spirit
of humble life. A woman sits at her door with a child on
her lap, talking to three neighbors; another is washing
kitchen utensils; a man and a dog are approaching. On
the left there are tall trees, and five cows beside a stream;
and farther back are cottages and a church-tower above
trees.</p>

<p><b>A Characteristic Picture by Van der Poel.</b>&mdash;Egbert
van der Poel has here a characteristic picture, Fire at Night
in a Village House. The house in flames occupies the
middle of the picture; many persons are trying to put out
the fire, and some are throwing water upon it. Several
neighboring houses and a clock-tower are lighted by the
glow of the flames.</p>

<p><b>Van Straaten's Washerwoman.</b>&mdash;Bruno van Straaten,

<p><b>An Interesting Kermesse by Droochsloot.</b>&mdash;Joost Cornelisz
Droochsloot, a native of Utrecht, who was born about
1586 and died after 1666, has an interesting <i>Kermesse</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
The scene is a village street, where a great number of peasants
are drinking, singing, and quarrelling. The houses are
half hidden by trees, and in the background is seen a clock-tower,
on the summit of which a red flag is floating.</p>

<p><b>An Interesting Picture of Low Life.</b>&mdash;An interesting
picture by Govert Camphuysen, who lived in the seventeenth
century, called Wagon Full of Drunken Peasants before
an Inn, shows a wagon drawn by a white and a brown
horse standing before an inn. About half a dozen men and
women are seated in it drinking and singing, and there is a
fiddler upon the front seat. The driver is cutting some
bread; by the door stands the hostess, who is pouring beer
into a pewter mug; a man with glass in hand is seen at an
open window; a beggar stands by the wagon; and a horseman
is riding along the road.</p>

<p><b>A Dutch Landscape by Van Os.</b>&mdash;Georgius Jacobus

of a house; and in the background are a shepherd with his
dog and some browsing sheep.</p>

<p><b>Two Landscapes.</b>&mdash;Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch, born in
Amsterdam in 1829, has a Landscape with Animals, representing
cattle in a meadow bright with sunshine. In the
foreground to the right is a watercourse, and in the middle
distance a mill. A Landscape in Guelderland by Anthonie
Jacobus van Wijngaerdt (1808- ) represents a sandy road
through a forest along which a man and a woman trudge
bearing fagots. The sky is full of clouds.</p>

<p><b>A Sunset, by Schipperus.</b>&mdash;Pieter Adriannus Schipperus

having an explanatory placard of the objects of interest
depicted.</p>

<p><b>A Village Picture by Van der Meer.</b>&mdash;Jan van der Meer
(1628-91) has a picture of The Village of Noordwijk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>

Town View, where upon a square in front of a Gothic
church three men are talking. One of them is accompanied
by a dog. On a stone parapet on the left is seated a person
with a basket on his back. In the background a canal
is seen with two boats on it, and behind the trees on the
quays some houses are visible. Another Town View by the
same painter shows a canal with a bridge, beneath which a
boat is passing. In the middle distance on the right there
is an old Dutch house, a part of which, as well as the church
with its clock-tower in the distance, is brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p><b>Two of De Hulst's now Rare Pictures.</b>&mdash;The pictures of
Frans de Hulst, a native of Haarlem, where he died in
1662, are now exceedingly rare. Two hang here. One is
a View of the Old Gate of the East at Hoorn, showing the
moat surrounding the town, and various boats, in one of
which the fishermen are drawing their nets. In the middle
distance is the old fortified gate (built in 1511 and now demolished)
and the drawbridge, and in the horizon a large
sheet of water. The View of Nymegen shows some travellers
arriving on the river bank in a chariot drawn by four
horses; the city is seen on the hills bordering the river
on the right, and beyond the walls and gates rises the
Valkhof with its square tower. The river is lost on the left.</p>

<p><b>Town Views, by Vertin.</b>&mdash;Petrus Gerardus Vertin (born
1820) has two Town Views. One represents some old
houses more or less dilapidated, and persons carrying merchandise
and talking; the second, a canal bordered with
very old Dutch houses. On the horizon a clock-tower is

houses, a church, and a clock-tower; and the other a street
covered with snow, with houses on either side, and many
figures.</p>

<p><b>Van Beest's Market.</b>&mdash;Sybrandt van Beest (d. 1665)
painted landscapes, marines, and <i>genre</i>. His pictures are
rare. He somewhat resembled Van Goyen in style. In
his Market, we see on the right a richly costumed gentleman
bargaining for a melon with a woman who is seated
before a table loaded with all kinds of fruit. Behind her
are a man and two women in conversation; an ass drawing
a cart is passing. To the left are a heap of vegetables and
a woman is picking up a red cabbage. The background is
composed of houses and a wall partly covered with verdure,
and several women in front, also selling vegetables. The
panel is signed and dated 1652.</p>

<p><b>De Witte's Fish Market at Amsterdam.</b>&mdash;Emanuel de
Witte's The Fish Market at Amsterdam is an interesting
picture. In the foreground under an awning near her stall,
where lie many kinds of fish, a fishwoman is standing and disputing
with a lady who has a white handkerchief on her head
and a blue satin jacket. On the right a fisherman is taking
off his hat to her. In the background a part of the quay,
Buitenkant, and the Y are seen.</p>

<p><b>Three Pictures of Fish-Sellers.</b>&mdash;Frans van Mieris the
Younger has a picture of a fish-seller standing behind his
stall; he holds a whiting in his right hand and two baskets
in his left; on the right are a tobacco-box, a knife, and a
pipe. On the left are some trees, and the sea extends on
the right into the background. Louis de Moni has The
Fishmonger. An old woman stands at a window where
dried fish are hanging; on the left is a spinning-wheel.
She is talking to a servant who is standing before the
window and who has a basket full of bread. Several houses
are seen in the background. The Herring Seller, by
Pieter Christoffel Wonder (1780-1852), belongs to this
group. A young woman is seated before the window of
her house and at her stall, on which are apples, cabbages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and onions. She has a pot on her knee and holds it with
her right hand, while in her left she offers a herring for
sale.</p>

<p><b>Two of Barent Gael's Good Pictures.</b>&mdash;Barent Gael
(d. 1663) was a pupil of Ph. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Wouvermans' and 'Wouwermans' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wouwermans</ins>; and, like his
master, painted battles and cavalcades with rich ordering,
careful drawing, and picturesque effect. He sometimes
painted more humble scenes, as in the Woman with Cakes.
She is making these appetizing dainties in front of a village
house, watched by a man and four children. To the left
are a hedge and some trees, and in the background a few
little houses. A beggar with his wife and child is trudging
along the road.</p>

<p>The Village Inn is not less interesting. Here a gentleman,
having alighted before the inn, stands with the bridle
in his left hand and a glass in his right, as he talks to a
man and woman seated on a bench. In the foreground
a dog is lying, and in the background are two horsemen
and some trees.</p>

<p><b>A Town View by Beerstraten, with Figures by Lingelbach.</b>&mdash;A.
Beerstraten, about whom little is known except
that he lived in Amsterdam in the seventeenth century, has
an interesting picture of The Old <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'town-hall' and 'town hall' were used in this text. This was retained.">Town Hall</ins> of Amsterdam,
built in the fifteenth century and destroyed by fire in 1652.
The old building on the Dam and the adjacent houses
are covered with snow. Persons of quality, and also merchants
and peasants, are seen walking through the snowy
streets in all directions. These little figures were painted
by Lingelbach.</p>

<p><b>Job Berckheyde's Old Bourse at Amsterdam.</b>&mdash;Another
architectural picture by Job Berckheyde (1630-93)
shows The Old Bourse at Amsterdam, built by De Keyser
in 1608-11, and destroyed in 1836. We see only a
portion of the interior of this building under the colonnade,
where many merchants are talking. Some of them are in
oriental costume. The picture is beautifully lighted by the
sun, which enters on the right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p><b>His Brother Gerard's Cologne.</b>&mdash;His brother Gerard
Berckheyde (1631-98?) has painted The Town of Cologne,
showing the quay, the wall, churches and other
buildings, with the Rhine on the left. The foreground is
beautifully lighted. A brown and white horse, wagons, and
boats enliven the scene.</p>

<p><b>Two Town Pictures by Verheijen.</b>&mdash;A fine view of The
Geertekerk at Utrecht by Jan Hendrik Verheijen (1778-1846)
shows the church on the right and the streets
enlivened with strollers, playing children, and a fish-seller.
His Town View, where brightly lighted buildings are seen
across the bridge of a canal, should also be noted.</p>

<p><b>St. Mary's Church, Utrecht, by Saenredam.</b>&mdash;Pieter
Jansz Saenredam (1597-65) is represented by St. Mary's
Church, Utrecht. This remarkable church, demolished
in 1813 or 1816, was a copy of a church of the eleventh
century in Milan. It dominates the picture, although
it stands on the right. Behind it are some houses,
and in front are trees and a square, on which men and
women are promenading, and children playing.</p>

<p><b>A Good Example of H. van Vliet's Style.</b>&mdash;The Interior
of a Protestant Church, by Hendrick van Vliet (1605-71),
is a good example of this painter's style. On the
left is the choir; in the centre of the foreground, an open
tomb; on the right, near a pillar, a gentleman whose back
is turned toward us, and who is accompanied by a dog.
Between the pillars the preacher in his pulpit and his
hearers are seen. The name and date, 1666, appear on
one of the pillars.</p>

<p><b>A Splendid Church Interior by Neeffs.</b>&mdash;Pieter Neeffs
the Elder has a splendid Interior of a Catholic Church,
showing the nave animated with many figures; chapels and
altars are on right and left, and the choir is in the background.</p>

<p><b>Two Church Interiors by Bosboom.</b>&mdash;Johannes Bosboom
(1817-91) has an Interior of a Protestant Temple, with
people walking about in costumes of the seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
century; and also an Interior of the Church of St. Laurence,
Alkmaar, also brightened with figures.</p>

<p><b>A Noted Picture by Klinkenberg, and Others by him.</b>&mdash;John
Christian Charles Klinkenberg (1852- ) is the modern
Dutch painter of towns, cities, and hamlets,&mdash;the Dutch
Canaletto. He is a pupil of Bisschop and Louis Meyer.
At first he was inclined to historical subjects, but soon
turned his attention to street views. It would be impossible
to enumerate them all,&mdash;the old water-gate at Sneek,
the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'town-hall' and 'town hall' were used in this text. This was retained.">town hall</ins> at Zutphen, the town-gate at Hoorn, the
market at Nymegen, the chancellory at Leeuwarden, the
old gate at Haarlem, the old streets of Amsterdam, and
the old buildings of The Hague. His noted picture representing
a View of the Vijver at The Hague was presented to
the Museum by the Rotterdam Society for Promoting Art
in 1876. The Royal Museum is represented on the right.</p>

<p><b>The Maas before Dordrecht, by S. van <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ruisdael' and 'Ruysdael' were used in this text. This was retained.">Ruisdael</ins>.</b>&mdash;The
view of a town seen across the river has always attracted
Dutch artists. Dordrecht and Rotterdam in particular have
been painted by Jan van Goyen, Cuijp, and others. One of
the most noted pictures of river scenes is The Maas before
Dordrecht by Salomon van Ruisdael. In the foreground,
to the right, is a shabby old pier on which some cows are
standing, while others are in the water. Row-boats and sail-boats
brighten the river, and one of them on the left is flying
the flag of Dordrecht. The town is seen on the horizon.</p>

<p><b>Burger's Opinion of this Artist.</b>&mdash;Burger says that this
artist formed his brother, and that he stands between Van
Goyen and the glorious Jacob. The picture just mentioned
he considers "as masterly as one of Jacob's works. The
distant horizon and the tiny sails, extremely fine in color,
harmonize with the beautiful silvery sky."</p>

<p><b>A Fine River Scene by Aelbert Cuijp.</b>&mdash;Aelbert Cuijp
has a beautiful View of the River in the Morning. On the
right, at the foot of a high mountain, a tongue of land advances
into the water; two shepherds are visible; some
cows are browsing, quenching their thirst, or lying down;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
and the river is dotted with row-boats and sail-boats. On
the left are some mountains, and in the background the
town lies on the banks of the river.</p>

<p><b>One of Pompe's Rare Works.</b>&mdash;A View of Rotterdam,
by a little-known painter, Gerrit Pompe (fl. 1700), whose
works are very rare, deserves study. The Maas, animated
with ships, occupies the foreground; on the left, the Admiralty
yacht is under full sail, and there is also a row-boat;
in the middle distance is a battleship; in the background
are some other boats; and still farther away extends the
town of Rotterdam. The painter has signed his name on a
floating plank.</p>

<p><b>Pompe's Rotterdam and Sonj&eacute;'s.</b>&mdash;It is interesting to
compare Pompe's Rotterdam with the View near Rotterdam
by Johannes Sonj&eacute;. Here we have the Rotter in the
foreground, on which a merchant ship and a row-boat are
seen. The river winds among the trees of the meadows,
which are animated with persons and animals. Under the
trees on the left is a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'farm-house' and 'farmhouse' were used in this text. This was retained.">farmhouse</ins>. Farther back are two
sail-boats, and in the background is the city.</p>

<p><b>A Beautiful River Scene by Van Goyen.</b>&mdash;J. van
Goyen, the father-in-law of Jan Steen, was particularly
famous for his landscapes and river scenery, a beautiful
example of which is called View of a River in Holland.
On the left is a jetty, from which fishermen are loading a
boat with baskets; in the middle distance is a boat with
fishermen drawing a seine; and in the background are a
mill and some houses on the bank. Several other sailing
and rowing boats are on the water, and on the horizon to
the left is a village.</p>

<p><b>Avercamp's Famous View of a River.</b>&mdash;Hendrik Avercamp
(fl. 1660) was famous in his day for his Dutch <i>kermesses</i>,
camp life, landscape, and still life. His View of a
River is full of life and color. In the left foreground are
two fishermen, and on the left a seated fisherman's wife.
The men are dragging a big seine. In the middle distance
to the right people are bathing and swimming; swans are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
on the stream, also boats with occupants; and there are
houses on the banks.</p>

<p><b>River Scenes by Willaerts, Father and Son.</b>&mdash;Isaac
Willaerts (fl. 1650) has a View of a River. On the left is
a village on a dike; on the right, a river with many sail-boats.
He was a pupil of his father, Adam. The Mouth
of the Meuse near Brielle, by Adam Willaerts, also belongs
to this group. In the foreground on the left stands an inn
with the sign In de Witte Zwaan (The White Swan), and
before it on a cask sits a wandering singer, surrounded by
fishermen and peasants; a little to the front are seen a
gentleman and his family, to whom an old fisherman offers
fish; on the banks of the river are groups of peasants,
sailors, and fishermen, talking, embracing the women, and
offering their arms to them for a promenade. Boats are
arriving and departing, and on the horizon lies the town.</p>

<p><b>A River Picture and Two Others by Verschuier.</b>&mdash;Lieve
Verschuier has The Maas before Rotterdam. The
river is seen on the right; on the left are the Bompjes
(the quay bordered with trees), the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Oude Hoofdpoort' and 'Oudehoofdpoort' were used in this text. This was retained.">Oudehoofdpoort</ins> (old
gate), and the Haringvliet (canal). Merchant vessels are
riding at anchor, and all sorts of boats are carrying merchandise
and passengers. In the foreground is a boat with
two fishermen. The same artist has here a Mountainous
Landscape, and the old Oostpoort at Rotterdam, built in
1611-13 and demolished in 1836.</p>

<p><b>Jongkind's Impressive Picture of Overschie in Moonlight.</b>&mdash;The
impressive picture, View of Overschie in Moonlight,
was purchased in 1893 out of a bequest by Mr.
Prainat at Rotterdam. After Jongkind settled in France
he frequently visited Holland, and this picture was painted
in 1872, during one of his visits. He was exceedingly fond
of Rotterdam and its environs. Overschie is a village near
Rotterdam, and the Schie, it may be noted, joins the Maas
at Delftshaven; upon it is situated Delft. It is interesting
to compare this picture with <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Gabri&euml;l' and 'Gabriel' were used in this text. This was retained.">Gabriel</ins>'s In the Environs of
Overschie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Jan Storck's Picture of the Old Gate at Rotterdam.</b>&mdash;Jan
Storck, whose Castle of Nyenrode is in the Rijks, has here
The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Oude Hoofdpoort' and 'Oudehoofdpoort' were used in this text. This was retained.">Oude Hoofdpoort</ins> at Rotterdam seen from the Maas.
In addition to the old gate (built in 1598 and demolished
in 1856), several boats are represented, and a yacht is just
leaving port amidst salvos of artillery. The Maas is seen to
the right.</p>

<p><b>Two Pictures Characteristic of A. Storck's Style.</b>&mdash;Abraham
Storck has two characteristic works. An Italian
Seaport has a jetty on the right with a large building and a
stone fountain. Several persons are busy discharging the
contents of the boats and galleys. On the left a sloop is
going toward a Dutch boat at anchor. His other picture is
A Dutch Port in Winter. A great hole appears in the ice in
the centre; on the right is a pole on which nets are drying;
on the left, a boat stuck fast in the ice: Farther along are
more imprisoned boats, some houses, and a mill; near the
bridge are a lady and gentleman in a sleigh; on the left,
two persons playing hockey; farther along are some skaters
and promenaders. In the background are two ships in the
ice; and on the horizon, some houses and a clock-tower.</p>

<p><b>Two Marines by Backhuysen.</b>&mdash;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Ludolf' and 'Lodewijk' Backhuysen/ Bakhuysen were used in this text. This was retained.">Ludolf</ins> Backhuysen has
a large View of the Dutch Coast in Stormy Weather, dated
1682. Ships of various sizes are endeavoring to escape an
approaching heavy squall. A marine, about one-third the
size of the above, is a calmer but bustling scene of ships of
war exchanging salutes at a place of embarkation.</p>

<p><b>A Marine, by Zeeman.</b>&mdash;Reinier Zeeman (16&mdash; after 1673),
whose pictures greatly resemble those of Jan Both and Claude
Lorraine, is represented by a marine. On the left some vessels
are in the roadstead, on the right other boats are off
for the deep, and on the banks sailors and fishermen are
seen.</p>

<p><b>Two Marines by Schotel.</b>&mdash;J. C. Schotel has an Agitated
Sea showing a brig at anchor and a fisherman's boat. A
lighthouse is seen on the shore to the right. Another,
called Au Moerdijk, represents a steamboat plying toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the landing, and in the background boats laden with hay.
The weather is calm.</p>

<p><b>The Port of Texel, by W. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Van de Velde,' 'Van der Velde,' and 'Vandervelde' were used in this text. This was retained.">van de Velde</ins>.</b>&mdash;A characteristic
example of Willem van de Velde is The Port of
Texel. On the left is a jetty from which large merchant
ships are preparing to leave, on the right the Admiralty
yacht firing salvos, in the foreground fishermen busy with
their nets, a boat containing several gentlemen, and in the
offing many boats leaving port.</p>

<p><b>A Sea-Strand, by Mans.</b>&mdash;Fredericus Mans (d. 1673)
has a panel called A Sea-Strand. In the foreground are
fishermen, peasants, and women. A road on the right leads
to a village in the dunes. On the left, the beach is animated
with many figures and fishing boats.</p>

<p><b>A Marine, by L. G. Man.</b>&mdash;L. G. Man (eighteenth
century) has a marine consisting of several English men-of-war
on a sunlit sea.</p>

<p><b>Sunset at Scheveningen and Two Other Pictures, by
Schelfhout.</b>&mdash;Andreas Schelfhout (1787-1870) has A Beach,
with the sea in the background, fishing-boats in the middle
distance, and a fisherman on the dunes, with his dog in the
foreground. A Winter Scene represents a frozen stream
where three children are playing with a sled; farther away
are some skaters; and to the right, the village houses beneath
wintry trees. Sunset at Scheveningen shows a beautifully
lighted sea; some boats with fishermen occupy the
middle distance; and the beach with promenaders is shown
in the foreground.</p>

<p><b>H. Koekkoek's Stormy Sea.</b>&mdash;Hermanus Koekkoek
(1815-82) was a pupil of his father, and, like him, a
marine painter. His Stormy Sea, showing various vessels
struggling with the elements, is full of force and atmospheric
effects.</p>

<p><b>Two Beautiful Marines by Mesdag.</b>&mdash;Two beautiful pictures
by the skilful marine-painter, H. W. Mesdag, should
be noted: Breakers on the North Sea Coast, presented by
Mr. C. E. van Stolk in 1885, depicts a scene that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
traveller himself may verify at any moment; and A Sunrise
on the Dutch Coast, presented by the Society for Promoting
Art at Rotterdam in 1876. This was painted in 1875.
Beautiful in color and striking in composition, it appeals
equally to the artist and the amateur.</p>

<p>A picture by Mrs. Mesdag, Moorland with a Sheepfold in
Moonlight, was presented to this gallery by her in 1904.</p>

<p><b>David de Heem, One of the First Painters of Still Life.</b>&mdash;This
gallery owns many pictures of fruits, flowers, animals,
and birds. David de Heem (1570-1632) was one of
the first to devote his talents almost exclusively to still life.
Neither The Hague nor the Rijks gallery contains an example
of his work. He treated with great minuteness flowers,
fruits, glasses, etc. Even during his own lifetime his
paintings were much sought after, and high prices were paid
for them. In his Flowers and Fruits we see a glass of Rhine
wine standing in a stone niche ornamented with carved
mouldings. The glass is garlanded with roses, honeysuckle,
pinks, and chrysanthemums; and grouped about it are white
grapes, peaches, apricots, plums, etc.</p>

<p><b>A Large Still-life Picture by Jan de Heem.</b>&mdash;His more
famous son, Jan Davidsz, who inherited his talents and tastes,
has here a large picture of still life. On a table partly
covered with a cloth of green velvet are arranged various
fruits,&mdash;grapes, peaches, figs, and a lemon partly peeled.
In the foreground is a pewter dish full of crabs, prawns, and
hazelnuts; then come a blue porcelain bowl and a pewter
plate with oranges and strawberries; next we have a basket
covered with a blue velvet cloth, on which is a pewter dish
with a cut ham. In the background is a box with gold and
silver fringe, and on it a wide-mouthed bottle of Rhine wine,
with a vine branch, a cooked crayfish, and some chestnuts.
To the left are two wine glasses and a silver plate of plums,
figs, and cherries. Well may Blanc exclaim:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is no eater so cloyed, no gourmet so <i>blas&eacute;</i>, who would
not have his appetite restored by the sight of one of De Heem's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
pictures; for here everything is exquisite, both the form and the
substance, the viands and the fruits, as well as the way in which
they are served. It is necessary that the eye should dine, says
the proverb; and this is particularly true of feasts and collations
given in painting.... De Heem has happily expressed the
quality of every viand and every fruit, its rough or smooth surface,
dull or shining, and even its stage of ripeness,&mdash;the violet
plum with its thin skin, splashed with red and drab, the light
down of the peach with its pale and purple tones, the plush envelope
in which the hazelnut hides, and the green and split
shell inside which we see the kernel. Moreover, this diversity
of substances is not only rendered by local color but also by
certain variations of the brush work by fine shades of touch.
On the oak or marble table is placed an enormous glass vessel
cut in facets, a patriarchal glass, all the ridges of which glitter in
the light, and through the crystal of which we see a golden
liquid, fused topaz. Sometimes it is a <i>roemer</i>, a cylindrical vase
of Bohemian glass mounted in silver, a precious utensil transmitted
from generation to generation. This is a picture that
transports us to the intimate life of these domestic Dutchmen,
attentive to all the delicacies of interior comfort."</p></div>

<p>Jan's son, Cornelis, has also a piece called Flowers and
Fruits in the same style.</p>

<p><b>Seghers's Flowers.</b>&mdash;The striking picture of Flowers,
by David Seghers, shows a stone cartouche with a little
bust of Ceres framed in a garland of red and white roses,
tulips, and many small flowers, around which hover numerous
butterflies.</p>

<p><b>W. C. H&eacute;da, an Early Still-life Painter.</b>&mdash;Willem Claes
H&eacute;da (1594-1668) was one of the earliest Dutchmen who
devoted themselves exclusively to the painting of still life.
H&eacute;da was the contemporary and companion of Dirk Hals,
with whom he had in common pictorial touch and technical
execution. But H&eacute;da was more careful and finished
than Hals, and showed considerable skill and not a little
taste in arranging and coloring chased cups and beakers
and tankards of precious and inferior metals. Nothing is
so appetizing as his Luncheon, with rare comestibles set
out upon rich plate, oysters,&mdash;seldom without the cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
lemon,&mdash;bread, champagne, olives, and pastry. Even the
commoner Refection is also not without charm, as it
comprises a cut ham, bread, walnuts, and beer.</p>

<p><b>Van Gelder and Gillemans, Famous Painters of Still
Life.</b>&mdash;N. van Gelder (d. 1660) painted birds, animals,
and flowers with great finish and delicacy. His Poultry
consists of a dead cock on a black marble plinth, partly
suspended by one of its feet from an iron hook fixed behind
a partly open green curtain. To the left are two shot
pigeons, a green velvet game-bag, and a fowling-piece.</p>

<p>Jan Paul Gillemans (1618-?) was famous for his still
life. This gallery possesses one of his fruit pieces, in which
grapes, oranges, lemons, plums, and apricots are temptingly
displayed.</p>

<p><b>Ykens, Painter of Flowers.</b>&mdash;Franchois Ykens (or
Ikens) (1601-93), a painter of flowers and pupil of his
uncle, Osias Beest, has a picture here that was formerly
attributed to Fran&ccedil;ois Seghers. A stone cartouche, surrounded
with a garland of roses, tulips, pinks, honeysuckle,
clematis, etc., and bearing a representation of the mystic
marriage of St. Catherine, is called simply Flowers.</p>

<p><b>W. van Aelst and his Famous Pupil, Rachel Ruysch.</b>&mdash;Willem
van Aelst delights us with his Flowers. On a
brown marble slab in a niche stands an elegant vase containing
roses, poppies, a pink, and other blossoms, around
which a butterfly is fluttering. A snail is crawling in the
niche. On a brown <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'table-cloth' and 'tablecloth' were used in this text. This was retained.">table-cloth</ins> with gold fringe, to the
right, is an open gold watch with a green ribbon attached.
The picture is signed and dated 1662. Willem's famous
pupil, Rachel Ruysch, may be seen here by a charming
flower piece. A tree-trunk surrounded by red and white
roses, poppies, convolvuluses, etc., and upon the stony
ground, covered with moss and mushrooms, innumerable
lizards, toads, snails, and various insects swarm. Butterflies
hover over the flowers. Rachel Ruysch painted this picture
in 1685, and gave it as a present to the famous painter,

in the loving rendering of lowly animal life. His
Nest is of natural size, with eggs lying on the moss near
some thistles, wild mulberries, and red mushrooms. Around
it flutter some butterflies; on the right is a lizard, and on
the left a Mayfly.</p>

<p><b>A. Breughel's Still-life Pictures.</b>&mdash;His pupil, Abraham
Breughel (1631-?), went to Rome; but little is known
about him except that his favorite subject was still life.
Like so many others, his flowers and fruits are painted
natural size. The principal objects in his picture are a
silver dish with figs, a silver bowl containing roses and
gladioluses at the foot of a column, and black and white
grapes, apples, etc., in the foreground.</p>

<p><b>A. Cuijp, a Painter Catholic in his Tastes.</b>&mdash;Aelbert
Cuijp was very catholic in his tastes. He occupied a
country house near Dordrecht, called Dordwijck, where he
painted everything that struck his fancy,&mdash;men, animals,
fruits, flowers, and landscape. The poultry yard is noticed
in a Cock and Hen scratching in the straw, with a broom
and some blocks of red stone conspicuously placed. A
hare, two pigeons, and other birds on a stone pillar compose
his Dead Game. A painting called Fruits represents
peaches on a blue plate on a table, and, beside the plate,
white grapes, cherries, and green gooseberries. On the left
is also a butterfly. A charming jumble of peaches, black
and white grapes, and various shells make the picture,
Fruits and Shells, in which three butterflies and a housefly
are also prominent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p><b>One of Jan Weenix's Many Dead Swans.</b>&mdash;No Dutch
gallery would be complete without a Dead Swan by Jan
Weenix. Sir Joshua Reynolds admitted that he had seen
no less than twenty during his visit to Holland. The dead
swan is here suspended by the foot from a stone pedestal;
on one side lie a peacock, a partridge, and a thrush; and
near them a branch from a rosebush and a basket of fruit.
In the background is seen a park with a lake, statues,
fountains, and large trees.</p>

<p><b>Two of Mignon's Best Pictures.</b>&mdash;Abraham Mignon
appears at his best in two pictures in this gallery called
Flowers and Fruits. In the former we admire a vase on a
stone table, filled with red and white roses, tulips, blue
irises, poppies, pinks, convolvuluses, and ears of wheat; on
the left on the table a mouse, snails, butterflies, beetles,
and other insects are painted with rare delicacy and truth.
Insects and snails also occur in the second picture, in which
the fruits are placed in a niche, and consist of a bunch of
black grapes, a peach, a melon, an apricot, and some plums
decorated with a vine leaf, wheat, and small flowers.</p>

<p><b>A Still Life by Van Beyeren.</b>&mdash;Abraham Hendricksz
van Beyeren was especially fond of painting flowers and
marine life. His Sea Fish is an evidence of his excellence
in this line. On a table is a basket containing whiting and
a slice of salmon; in front of the basket are a crab, some
soles, some slices of cod, and a knife.</p>

<p><b>Van den Broeck's Flowers.</b>&mdash;Elias van den Broeck
(1653-1711), a pupil of Jan de Heem, delighted to immortalize
on canvas the flowers he cultivated in his beautiful
garden. A stone plinth with roses and Indian cress;
and, in front, chrysanthemums and creepers, a lizard, two
snails, and butterflies are the chief features of his Flowers.</p>

<p><b>Van Os, Another Good Flower-painter.</b>&mdash;Georgius Jacobus
Johannes van Os (1782-1861) was a worthy successor
of the seventeenth-century masters of this school. Flowers
and Flowers and Fruits are artistically composed and lovingly
painted. The former consists of an Etruscan vase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
filled with roses, blue irises, tulips, and anemones, standing
on a marble table. The second picture represents, on a
marble plinth in a niche, a melon, a pear, and a bunch of black
grapes with roses, convolvuluses, poppies, and other flowers.</p>

<p><b>His Pupil, Hendrik Reekers.</b>&mdash;His pupil, Hendrik
Reekers (1815-54), has here Fruits, Vegetables, and Game,
arranged on a marble table. A basket is full of white and
black grapes, a cut lemon, and some oranges, plums, peaches,
and an artichoke, mingled with flowers. Above these hang
a partridge and a grouse.</p>

<p><b>Flowers, by Steenbergen.</b>&mdash;Flowers, by Albertus Steenbergen
(1814- ), consists of roses, poppies, lilacs, convolvuluses,
nasturtiums, etc., arranged in a vase that stands
on a marble plinth. On the right flutters a butterfly.</p>

<p><b>Still Life, by Maria Vos.</b>&mdash;Still Life by Maria Vos
(b. 1824) consists of a stone plinth partly covered with a
piece of matting on which stand a white cock and a black
hen, an overturned basket of oranges and lemons, a copper
dish, and a porcelain bowl; and on the wall a stone jug
with a pewter top.</p>

<p><b>Flowers, by Margaretha Roosenboom.</b>&mdash;In Flowers, by
Margaretha Roosenboom (1843), we have a silver vase filled
with roses, standing on a table with a green cover. In the
background, a green curtain is half drawn.</p>

<p><b>Two Excellent Hunting Scenes by Hondius.</b>&mdash;Abraham
Hondius (1638-91), who excelled in painting the different
breeds of dogs and other animals, and hunting scenes, with
much fire and action, has two pictures here. A Boar Defending
Itself Against Dogs shows the furious beast at bay,
with four dying or dead dogs under him in the foreground.
On the left three more dogs are rushing to the attack. The
features of the landscape are three trees, with a mountainous
background. The other picture, of exactly the same size, depicts
a Bear Attacked by Dogs. The bear is standing on his
hind legs with a dog under him, and throwing another into
the air, while he hugs the life out of another. On the right
and left, more dogs are rushing to attack. There is a dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
dog in the left foreground. On the right, in the middle
distance, there are two trees near a rock, and a cascade,
and the background is mountainous. Both pictures are
signed and dated 1672.</p>

<p><b>Bird Pictures by the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins>s, Father and Son.</b>&mdash;Gijsbert
de Hondecoeter shows his loving study of the gallinaceous
tribe in Cock and Hens. In the foreground is a
black hen with a white comb; and behind her are a sitting
yellow hen and a standing white one; still farther back are
three more hens, one perched on the branch of a tree. To
the left sits a brown hen with a black comb, with a yellow-brown
cock behind. The ground is strewed with oyster
shells and straw. Three hens are in the background. The
picture is signed and dated 1652.</p>

<p>Melchior de <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Hondecoeter' and 'Hondekoeter' were used in this text. This was retained.">Hondecoeter</ins>, who surpassed his father as a
painter of birds alive and dead, enriches this collection with
his Dead Game. In a grotto at the foot of some ruins a
dead bittern and two partridges are hanging. In front are
two gulls; and on the right are a hunting-horn, tied with a
red tasselled cord, a green velvet bag, a kingfisher, and
two finches. In the middle distance is a fowling-piece
with a shoulder belt and net. The entrance of the grotto
is in the background on the left.</p>

<p><b>Four Portrait Groups by the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Eversdijck' and 'Eversdijcks' were used in this text. This was retained.">Eversdijcks</ins>.</b>&mdash;In common
with all other Dutch galleries, the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Boijmans' and 'Boijman's' were used in this text. This was retained.">Boijmans</ins> is rich in portraits.
Royalties, admirals, officers, ladies of quality, gentlemen,
elderly men and women, and children are all represented.
Three pictures of gatherings of officers at Goes,
by Cornelis Willemsz Eversdijck, who died in his native
town of Goes about 1649, and one by his son Willem,
representing the same corps of archers, are the only important
pictures of this class in the gallery.</p>

<p><b>Two Portraits by Mostert, and One by Queborn.</b>&mdash;Jan
Mostert (1474-?), who was a painter of portraits and
altarpieces, has here two half-lengths of Augusteyn van
Teylingen, Anno 1511, and Judoca van Egmont van der
Nieuburch, 1511 (his wife).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>Crispyn van den Queborn (1604-58) was a distinguished
portrait-painter and engraver. His half-length Portrait of
Hartogh van Moerkerken was painted in 1645.</p>

<p><b>Santvoort, a Portrait-painter after the Style of Rembrandt.</b>&mdash;Dirk
van Santvoort (d. 1660) was probably one
of Rembrandt's pupils; or, at least, he adopted that master's
manner. Not many of his pictures are known, and the majority
of these are portraits. His two pictures in the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Boijmans' and 'Boijman's' were used in this text. This was retained.">Boijmans</ins>
Museum, however, belong rather to the classical school
of the Elzheimers and Poelenburgs. A Young Shepherd
Playing the Chalumeau, wearing a brown cap with an ostrich
feather, and a bright brown robe over a white shirt, with a
knife and horn at his belt (green background), is dated
1632. A Young Shepherdess, half-length, turned to the left,
wears a violet dress with red sleeves. A blue hat with a
green branch is on her head and a crook over her right
shoulder. The background is greenish.</p>

<p><b>Two Portraits by F. Bol.</b>&mdash;Ferdinand Bol's Portrait of a
Woman represents a young woman seen in profile half-length,
and turned to the left. She wears a red dress and
a violet velvet mantle lined with fur. Beautiful ornaments
of gold and pearls are in her hair and on her neck and
arms. One hand rests on the base of a column, and the
other holds a closed fan. His portrait of Dirk van <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both Dirk Van 'Waeijen' and 'Walijen' were used in this text. This was retained.">Walijen</ins>
represents a young boy with long curls, dressed in yellow
satin, red tunic, and yellow boots.</p>

<p><b>Portrait by Gerrit Dou.</b>&mdash;Among the most striking portraits
is that of An Old Lady by Gerrit Dou. She is
dressed in black velvet trimmed with fur; her bodice is of
black silk, and she wears a large turned-down collar, and
round her neck a gold chain with a pendent jewel. She
has on a blue cap with a gold band. The head stands out
boldly from the grayish background, and the expression of
the smiling face is singularly impressive.</p>

<p><b>Jacob Cats and his Cousin, by Mytens.</b>&mdash;Mytens's Portrait
of Jacob Cats, the Dutch poet, and his cousin Cornelia
Bars, is also of interest. It was painted in 1650, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
represents Jacob Cats seated at a table before a tent. He
is dressed in crimson, and turns toward his cousin at his
side, who wears brown silk. On the table, with its red
carpet, are an open book and an inkstand. On the left is
seen a hilly landscape with trees; and in the background
an angel with a long white robe.</p>

<p><b>Portraits by Opzoomer.</b>&mdash;Simon Opzoomer has a portrait
of Rembertus Frescarode, one called Erasmus in his
Study, and one of the Brothers de Witt in Prison in
Gevangenpoort. Cornelis is in bed, and Jacob is seated

their murder by the populace in 1672.</p>

<p><b>Portraits of Two Notables by Mierevelt.</b>&mdash;Mierevelt
has a Portrait of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, painted in 1671.
His Maurice of Nassau shows that prince standing by a
table and wearing a richly worked cuirass, the present of
the States-General after the victory of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Nienwpoort'">Nieuwpoort</ins>, and an
orange silk scarf. He holds a commandant's baton in his
right hand, and his helmet with orange plumes is seen on
the table. Mierevelt has here also A Lady of Quality.</p>

<p><b>Finely painted Portraits by Nason.</b>&mdash;Pieter Nason
(1612-90), who painted portraits and still life, and who
has a Portrait of Willem Frederick, Count of Nassau
(1662), in The Hague, has here The Portrait of a Lord,
and one of A Woman of Quality. The lady is holding
some yellow flowers. She is dressed in red silk with white
undersleeves; a brown scarf falls over her shoulders; and
pearls ornament her hair, ears, and neck. The jewels, silks,
and satins are beautifully painted, as is also the costume of
the lord in the accompanying picture. He is dressed in
yellow silk with a brown mantle, and his lace cravat is held
by a circle of diamonds. Trees form the background.</p>

The lady is represented with powdered hair and dressed in
brown satin with lace at the neck and sleeves. Her right
hand is lifted and holds a veil. The background contains
a column and a green curtain. Pool's portrait of her
father, Professor Frederik Ruysch, is also a bust. He
wears a large powdered wig and a long robe with a band;
his left hand holds a skull.</p>

<p><b>A Portrait Group by Maes.</b>&mdash;Nicholas Maes is represented
by a Portrait of a Gentleman and a Lady standing
in front of a noble house. The lady, in black with a gray

<p><b>Good Pictures of Social Life by Palamedesz.</b>&mdash;Anthonie
Palamedesz (1601-73) was a painter of social life,
<i>corps-de-gardes</i>, portraits, landscapes, and still life. His
art belonged to the school of Frans Hals. The quality of
his work is very unequal, but many of his interiors are full
of life and color. He was such a good painter of figures
in landscapes that his aid was much sought after by brother
artists, notably B. van Bassen and A. de Lorme. In The
Hague Gallery he has two works that show him at his best,&mdash;Music
after Dinner, and Merry Company; also a Portrait
of Martinus van Stavenisse, Knight of St. Michael.</p>

<p><b>An Interior of High Life, by Palamedesz.</b>&mdash;The Rotterdam
Gallery has An Interior of High Life by this artist.
In an apartment hung with gilded leather several ladies and
gentlemen are talking and playing musical instruments. In

red tunic; next to her is a gentleman holding a guitar. On
the left there is a lady with a sheet of music in her hand.
She wears a white dress and a yellow tunic, and beside her
is seated a gentleman. In the centre of the room there
is a table covered with a red carpet, at which two persons
are seated. Farther back in the room several groups of
ladies and gentlemen are seen; and in the background

<p><b>A Musical Reunion, by Van Deelen.</b>&mdash;A Musical Reunion
by Dirk van Deelen (1605-71) is a scene in high
life. Six gentlemen and four ladies are in a hall paved
with blue and white marble. A gentleman who turns his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
back to the spectator is seen in the foreground. He is
dressed in black satin slashed with yellow, a black velvet
cloak, yellow stockings, red-heeled shoes, lace collar, and
large black hat. At the right a lady is leaning on a table
with a red cloth. She wears a black-and-yellow flowered
dress with a red tunic and large lace collar and sleeves.
Near the table, on which are a guitar and some books of
music, are four gentlemen, one of whom is without his hat.
In the centre a lady dressed in green silk is playing the
guitar, with her foot on a foot-warmer. Beside her stand
a gentleman and two ladies, one of whom wears a black
dress with a yellow satin tunic and holds a book of music.
In the background on the right there is a bed with green
curtains and an open door flanked with columns at each
side. On the left are two tall windows, and on the wall
hang two male portraits.</p>

<p><b>An Architectural Painting by Van Deelen.</b>&mdash;The Peristyle
of a Building, by this artist, shows his love for classic
architecture. A stone bath with steps occupies the foreground,
and two men enveloped in long cloaks talk with a
woman who is seated on the steps. Near it is a statue
of Hercules on a red marble pedestal. Many people are
seen in a distant gallery through the columns.</p>

<p><b>A Delightful Conversation Piece, by Ochtervelt.</b>&mdash;The
Collation, by Jacob Ochtervelt, is one of those delightful
"conversation pieces" so popular in the seventeenth century.
A young woman in a yellow satin skirt and a red
velvet jacket bordered with white fur is seated on a tabouret
of green velvet with her back turned toward the spectator.
Her left hand rests on her hip and her right holds a glass
of wine. On her right is a table with an Oriental carpet
upon which stands a flagon of wine. By its side is an
officer in a blue costume and large blond wig, who is handing
some oysters in a silver dish to the young woman.</p>

leather, and from the ceiling of which is suspended a
copper chandelier ornamented with a two-headed eagle,
a lady is seated before the mantelpiece near a table
covered with a Smyrna rug. She is dressed in white,
with a red petticoat, and some red bows on her breast.
Around her are six children of different ages, including one
in the arms of a servant. Opposite to her is a gentleman
dressed in black with white sleeves, accompanied by a dog;
a little behind is a servant with an inkstand. On the left
an aged woman dressed in black is seen, and two ladies
and a gentleman enter the chamber on the left. Over the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'chimney-piece' and 'chimney piece' were used in this text. This was retained.">chimney-piece</ins> is a beautifully painted landscape, and on
the left against the wall a large <i>armoire</i> or <i>kas</i> of black
wood ornamented with gold, above which hangs a large
portrait.</p>

<p><b>A Village Interior, by C. de Man.</b>&mdash;Cornelus de Man
(1621-1706) painted portraits, churches, and social life.
In The Hague Gallery he has a Peasants' Wedding, and
here his qualities may be studied in A Village Interior.
A joyous company of peasants, with a sprinkling of the
better class, are gathered in a big barn. In the centre,
a couple are dancing,&mdash;the man holding aloft a pewter
pot. On the right a group are playing "hot cockles." In
front, there is a dog asleep; on the right, a little girl with
a hoop; and on the left, a peasant asleep on a barrel.
Farther back is a long table covered with food, at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
several men and women are seated. A violinist sits on
a barrel, and a guest is sitting on the table mimicking him
with tongs; on the floor in front of him is an earthen
pitcher with a pewter lid. In the background are two
individuals, one with a drum. A black bird is on a perch
close to the ceiling.</p>

<p><b>Two Pictures of Rustic Life by Molenaer.</b>&mdash;Two pictures
by Jan Miense Molenaer are owned by this gallery,&mdash;The
Clarinet Player and Rustic Gaiety. The former represents
a peasant's house, where a man with his foot resting on
a stool is playing the clarinet; his audience consists of two
peasants, one of whom is sitting and the other standing by
the side of the fire.</p>

<p>Music is the feature of Rustic Gaiety also. A table with
a green cover is set with pewter plates and bread; seated
thereat is a peasant, dressed in green blouse and wearing
a red cap, his face turned toward the spectator. His left
hand rests on his leg and he holds a glass of wine in his
right. Opposite is a woman singing and playing the
guitar; a little farther away another woman, with a glass
of wine in one hand and a jug in the other, is also singing.
In the background a peasant, seated near a barrel, is lighting
a pipe, and still farther back a man is playing a fiddle.</p>

<p><b>A Village Interior, by Sorgh.</b>&mdash;Hendrik Maertinsz
Sorgh, who died in Rotterdam in 1670, and who was a
pupil of David Teniers, reflects his master in A Village
Interior. Here we have the interior of a barn where five
peasants are eating and drinking around a table, at which
is also seated an old woman whose hands are resting on
a jug. On the left is a brick oven, and utensils of various
kinds hang on the wall. Many articles are scattered
about, including a leather slipper, a wooden spoon, some
mussel shells, a tub of onions, etc. From the ceiling hangs
a wicker bird-cage and in the foreground a cock and hen
are strutting about.</p>

<p><b>The Market in Rotterdam, by Sorgh.</b>&mdash;Another picture
represents an animated scene at The Market in Rotterdam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
In the foreground a vegetable stall is placed against the
<i>fa&ccedil;ade</i> of a house. A woman carrying a copper pail is
selecting some vegetables and disputing with the vender.
Farther back more buyers and sellers are arguing; and the
background is closed with some houses and the entrance
to the Nieuwsteeg.</p>

<p><b>A Village Interior, by <ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'Wijck,' 'Wyck,' and 'Wijk' were used in this text. This was retained.">Wyck</ins>.</b>&mdash;A Village Interior, by
Thomas Wyck (1616-77), shows a room in which a woman
is seated; a little boy kneeling has his head in her lap; by
her side is a little girl, and other little girls are sitting on
the floor; under the window on the left a child is sitting at
a table with a red carpet; on the right, in the foreground,
stands a barrel on which is a jug. A wooden stairway
is seen in the background.</p>

<p><b>Two Paintings illustrating the Versatility of Quellinus.</b>&mdash;Erasmus
Quellinus (1607-78) was a pupil of Rubens,
and painted history, architecture, landscape, portraits, and
religious subjects, like his master. He was a strong colorist
and his draughtsmanship is excellent. Two sides of his art
are exhibited in The Ascension of the Virgin and A Woman
in a Kitchen. The latter is a fine study of still life in the
rendering of the various utensils. On the right a young
woman with bare arms, a white cap, a red dress, and white
tunic is represented down to the knees; on the left on the
table and by its side are all sorts of pewter, copper, and
earthenware utensils. Behind the table stands a young
negress who is offering a bunch of cherries to the woman.</p>

<p><b>A Fine Example of Kalff's Still-life Painting.</b>&mdash;Another
study of still life is shown in The Village Kitchen, by Willem
Kalff, a fine example of this master. In the background a
woman is preparing vegetables, a man stands near a ladder
with a basket filled with vegetables, and another woman is
coming through an open door; but these figures are subordinate
in interest to the pots, kettles, and pans of shining
copper; the meat hanging from the ceiling; the bottles,
the casks, milk jugs, white linen, beer, artichokes, onions,
cabbages, and other vegetables and fruits variously arranged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Koninck's Famous Gold Weigher.</b>&mdash;Of single figures perhaps
the most famous is by Salomon Koninck (1609-68?),
pupil of N. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Moeyaert' and 'Moijaert' were used in this text. This was retained.">Moijaert</ins>. The Gold Weigher, an old man with
white hair and beard, is seated at a table. He wears a
doublet of green velvet and gray fur, and a crimson velvet
cap; he weighs the gold with the greatest care in a pair of
scales which he holds in his right hand. He holds a piece
of gold in his left hand also. On the table, which is covered
with a red cloth, are books, a sheet of paper, a box of
weights, and a bag of gold. The light falls through a window
on the left.</p>

<p><b>Van der Neer's Guitar Player.</b>&mdash;The Guitar Player, by
Eglon Hendrik van der Neer, is probably a portrait. Here
we see a young woman dressed in a red satin skirt and a
white satin jacket, seated by a clavecin. She is tuning a
guitar; and not far away is a gentleman who has a glass of
wine in his hand.</p>

<p><b>Pencz's Savant in his Cabinet.</b>&mdash;George Pencz (d. 1550)
was a pupil of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'Albert' and 'Albrecht' D&uuml;rer were used in this text. This was retained.">Albert</ins> D&uuml;rer, who also went to Rome and
studied under Raphael. He painted therefore much the
same class of subjects and in the same style as Van Orley.
His Savant in his Cabinet is an interesting interior. The
savant is seated at a table covered with a green carpet, his
head rests on his right hand, and his left is extended toward
a death's head. He is dressed in red and wears a red cap.
Behind the table is a desk on which are an open book and
a copper chandelier with an extinguished candle. Through
an open window in the background a landscape is visible.</p>

<p><b>The Drinker, by D. Ryckaert.</b>&mdash;Another good study is
The Drinker, by David Ryckaert (1612-77), a pupil of
his father, Maerten Ryckaert, and who formed himself on
Teniers, Brouwer, and Ostade. The man in a brown coat
with red sleeves and a red cap is seated at a table with a
pewter mug in one hand and a pipe in the other. A pewter
plate and an earthenware jug stand on the table.</p>

<p><b>Pictures containing Human Figures, by Muys.</b>&mdash;Nicholas
Muys (1740-1808) has three scenes in <i>grisaille</i> from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
plays, A Study in Light, two Interiors, and a Landscape with
Figures. The last shows a monument in the shadow of an
oak, and before it a gentleman, lady, and little child in the
costume of the end of the eighteenth century. A beggar
and his family sue for charity. Near the monument are
three other persons. Two ducks are being pursued by dogs
in the foreground, a hut is seen among the trees in the distance,
and a village lies on the horizon.</p>

<p>One of the Interiors represents an apartment of the eighteenth
century, where a lady dressed in a green robe is
showing a little picture to two gentlemen. The other Interior
is a richly carved vestibule, in which stands a lady in a
violet silk dress and a blue hat; by her side on the floor
are a dead heron, a partridge, a hare, and some rabbits, and
the live greyhound that helped to catch them. Through a
door in the centre is seen the kitchen, where the huntsman
and his wife are preparing the vegetables; and there are
two other persons, one of whom is hanging a cage from the
ceiling.</p>

<p>In A Study in Light the painter has grouped a number of
objects,&mdash;a bust of Homer on a white marble table, a
guitar, music-books, and a chair with a violin on it,&mdash;and
lighted them from a candle in a silver chandelier. In the
background a lady is standing before an open clavecin with
a sheet of music in her hand.</p>

<p><b>An Interior, by J. B. Scheffer.</b>&mdash;Johan Baptist Scheffer,
who died in Amsterdam in 1809, has here An Interior,
showing a room in which a young peasant woman is sitting
at a table preparing vegetables. Beside her stands a pedler
who has placed his right hand on her shoulder, while his
left dangles a gold chain before her eyes. On the left, a
little girl is amusing herself by scaring a cat with her dog;
in the background an open door gives a view through the
next room into the street.</p>

<p><b>Ary Scheffer's Training.</b>&mdash;Scheffer's more famous son,
Arie (1795-1858), inherited talent also from his mother,
Cornelia Lamme, a very distinguished miniature-painter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
He received his first instruction from his father and in
Paris studied under Pierre Gu&eacute;rin. G&eacute;ricault and Eug&egrave;ne
Delacroix joined him in striking into a new path of art.</p>

<p><b>His Two Paintings of Ulrich of W&uuml;rtemburg.</b>&mdash;Here Arie
Scheffer has two sketches&mdash;Heads of Two Children, and A
Shepherd Under a Stormy Sky, and two large canvases on
Uhland's ballad representing Ulrich, son of Count Eberhard
of W&uuml;rtemburg. He first represents the young warrior who,
having lost the Battle of Reutlingen, returns to Stuttgart
and finds his father at the table alone. He has a cold welcome;
and Count Eberhard without greeting him takes a
knife and cuts the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Both 'table-cloth' and 'tablecloth' were used in this text. This was retained.">table-cloth</ins> in halves. In Scheffer's picture
Ulrich is standing by the table on the right, and the
angry father is cutting the table-cloth. Exasperated by
this insult, Ulrich returned to the army and, throwing himself
into the thickest of the fray at Doffingen, was killed.
The old count spent the night weeping over the body of his
only son. The companion picture, called The Weeper,
represents the bereaved father with clasped hands seated by
Ulrich's body, which still is in armor and lying on a bearskin
in the tent.</p>

<p><b>Hendrik Scheffer's The First Child.</b>&mdash;Arie's younger
brother, Hendrik Scheffer (1798-1862), also a pupil of
Gu&eacute;rin, was a capable painter whose work, The First Child,
hangs in this gallery. A young mother in bed receives a
visit from her husband, who is kissing her hand. On the
right the nurse is seen with the child in her arms.</p>

<p><b>A Similar Picture by Cornelis Troost.</b>&mdash;Another similar
picture is by Cornelis Troost. The lady is lying in bed
eating her breakfast. Near her are a cradle, a nurse with
the baby, and a little girl. The wall is hung with portraits,
and a clock and a painted screen are seen.</p>

<p><b>Brakenburg's Malade Imaginaire and Interior.</b>&mdash;Richard
Brakenburg (1650-1702), a pupil of Ostade, has a
<i>Malade Imaginaire</i>, in which a young woman in blue rests
languidly on her pillow, attended by a physician, who is
feeling her pulse. A little dog plays by her side, and several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
persons are variously grouped and laughing. A parrot
cage hangs from the ceiling. This picture is dated 1696.
A different phase of life appears in his Interior, showing a
large room full of peasants, including women and children.
They are laughing at an owl on a perch, because a man
dressed in a black satin doublet is giving it a piece of
cake on the point of a knife. A bird-cage hangs from the
ceiling.</p>

<p><b>Bollongier's Carnival.</b>&mdash;Hans or Johan Bollongier, who
lived in the middle of the seventeenth century, has a Carnival.
A man and woman are dancing in a street, the
former being dressed as a savage and carrying a club; an
individual follows them with a "rommel pot." In the foreground
we see a dog, and a man in a blue toga, holding a
sword and an imperial globe in his hands. Behind these
persons a house is visible, the doors and windows of which
are filled with people. The picture is dated 1720.</p>

<p><b>Jan Steen's Feast of St. Nicholas.</b>&mdash;Turning now to
humorous pictures, Jan Steen affords two. The Feast of
St. Nicholas differs slightly from the one in the Rijks, and
represents the painter's family. On the right is seated a
young woman in a white satin dress and a blue velvet jacket
trimmed with white fur. She is holding out her hands to a
little girl, whose arms are full of spiced bread and other
dainties. On the left a boy is crying behind the table, on
which is a shoe containing a switch, and near him a servant,
a boy, and an elderly man are laughing at his distress.
The last has a glass of wine in his hand. Behind the group
is an old woman, who is showing a piece of silver to the
poor little boy to console him for St. Nicholas's present.</p>

<p><b>Another Humorous Picture by Jan Steen.</b>&mdash;Another
picture which shows Jan Steen in his most humorous vein
is The Operator, who is removing the stones from a man's
head. In Holland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
to say that a man had "a stone in his head" was only
the equivalent for saying that he was "cracked"; and "to
extract the stone from one's brain" merely meant to cure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
him of his folly. The patient is seated in a surgeon's office,
and the surgeon, who is behind him performing an imaginary
operation, ostentatiously places some stones in a basin
that an old woman is holding in the full view of the patient.
On the left stands a boy with a basket full of stones, from
which the surgeon supplies himself. The patient's arms
are tightly bound with a rope of straw; a crow is pecking
at his hand, and he is screaming with all his might. Some
spectators at an open window are laughing heartily.</p>

<p><b>A Similar Picture in the Style of Frans Hals.</b>&mdash;This
may be compared with a picture of the school of Frans
Hals, called The Quack Doctor. The doctor pretends to
be cutting stones from the head of a man. To his cap is
fastened a piece of parchment with Hebrew letters and
three seals, and he wears spectacles. The patient is crying
out; and a boy, dressed as a negro, stands in front
with a basin full of stones. On the right is a table covered
with a red cloth, upon which are scissors and other instruments,
books, gourds, and a water bottle.</p>

<p><b>Cuijp's Eater of Mussels.</b>&mdash;Aelbert Cuijp's Eater of
Mussels has a double interest because the painter has
represented himself here. The scene is laid in a forge,
where the master is eating mussels from a plate that stands
beside a glass of beer on a keg. Two little girls and a boy
are watching him with great attention, and through an open
window two gentlemen are peeping in from outside. One
has a glass of wine in his hand, and the other is the artist
himself, who is laughing heartily at the man devouring the
mussels. In the foreground are seen a dog, a large jug, an
anvil, some shells, an overturned basket of wood, a cat, and
a hen. In the background are seen a blacksmith and
many utensils.</p>

<p><b>Two Bright Pictures by Van Stry.</b>&mdash;Abraham van Stry
(1753-1826), a pupil of his father, the architectural painter,
has an amusing Table Well Served. In a middle-class room
a fat man is seated at a table, on which stand a fine roast
and other dishes. He casts an approving glance upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
dish which a servant is just bringing in. Behind him another
servant is pouring out some wine. This artist's
Village Inn represents a peasant on a white horse. He is
taking a glass of beer from the innkeeper's wife. A servant,
a barking dog, a woman, and a boy are the other figures.
The sunlight is very vivid.</p>

<p><b>Some Characteristic Examples of the Early Netherlands
School.</b>&mdash;The early Netherlands school is well represented
by a few characteristic examples. Toost van der Beke,
called "The Master of the Death of the Virgin Mary," may
be studied by three pictures,&mdash;Saint Jerome in his Study,
the Virgin Mary and the Infant Jesus, and Portrait of Joris
van der Helde (who died in Ghent in 1569). Dierick,
or Dirck, Bouts is represented by The Apostle Saint John,
which was formerly attributed to Rogier van der Weijden.
Saint John is seated in a landscape writing the first verse of
his Gospel on a sheet of paper, and a devil is tormenting
him.</p>

<p>"The Master of the Half-Length Female Figures," a
Dutch painter who is supposed to have worked at Bruges
between 1520 and 1540, and who is known only by his
pictures of saints on altarpieces and young women playing
musical instruments, may be studied here in pictures called
Golgotha and Young Woman Playing on a Lute. The latter
is dressed in the costume of 1540, and she is singing from
a music-book the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Si jayme mon amy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trop, plus que mon mary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Se n'est pas de mervelles."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Golgotha represents the Crucifixion. The Cross, bearing
the livid figure of Christ, is in the foreground, and beside it
stand the Virgin on the left and St. John on the right. The
landscape is very fine, but is entirely Flemish in character,
although soldiers are supposed to be returning to the distant
Jerusalem. At the foot of the hills Flemish cottages
are noticeable, and the sky is gradually darkened from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
sun on the horizon, until it gets very black just above the
Cross.</p>

<p>This may be compared with The Crucifixion of Christ of
the Netherlands school, an altarpiece of the sixteenth century,
formerly attributed to Bernard van Orley (died in
Brussels in 1525). Like the former, it presents a green
landscape with horsemen wending their way to the distant
Jerusalem. The Virgin and St. John are kneeling at the
foot of the Cross, and in the clouds are two female saints,
God the Father, and the dove representing the Holy
Ghost.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
